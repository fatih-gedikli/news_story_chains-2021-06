The cooperation aims at advancing GEV’s Approval in Principle (AiP) application for its new 430-ton C-H2 vessel. It is also intended to demonstrate the availability of a highly efficient, low-emissions propulsion system for the vessel. GEV revealed the design of a new compressed hydrogen ship (H2 Ship) tailored for the transport of zero-carbon energy late last year. The Aussie developer of global integrated marine compressed natural gas (CNG) projects anticipates that detailed engineering will be lodged as part of the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Approval in Principle process in early 2021. The H2 Ship is designed to have a storage capacity of up to 2,000 tonnes (23 million m3) of compressed hydrogen. The containment system will include ambient temperature hydrogen at a target pressure of 3,600 psi (or 250 bar). The ship’s containment system won an AiP from ABS earlier this year. The system is made up of two large (20 metre diameter) tanks, contained within the hull of the ship, that will store ambient temperature hydrogen at an operating pressure of 3,600 psi (250 bar) and will have a combined containment capacity of 2,000 tonnes of hydrogen. GEV will now work with ABS to progress the various engineering steps towards Full Class Approval, i.e. approval for construction, similar to that achieved by GEV for its CNG Optimum ship. “We look forward to working closely with Wärtsilä on this project. We have shown that C-H2 shipping is ideally suited for exporting green hydrogen with a lower delivered cost and having a technology leader such as Wärtsilä with us, we can deliver a shipping solution that is completely sustainable,” says Martin Carolan, CEO, GEV. “This project is an important steppingstone along the journey towards a decarbonised maritime industry, something that Wärtsilä is fully committed to supporting. We are actively developing propulsion alternatives that can utilise future carbon-neutral fuels, raise efficiency levels, and which significantly improve environmental performance,” says Petteri Saares, Sales Director, Wärtsilä Marine Power. Compression has been singled out by the industry as the preferred solution for marine hydrogen transport but is often overlooked due to its lower volumetric energy density. The duo believes that the C-H2 project will eliminate the technical barriers and deliver a solution which is superior to other transport alternatives. GEV is in discussions with parties to evaluate the C-H2 supply chain for future hydrogen export projects, while also identifying suitable sites for the development of its own pilot-scale renewable green hydrogen project for a fully integrated green C-H2 supply chain.","The technology group Wärtsilä has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Global Energy Ventures (GEV) of Australia to cooperate on the inclusion of Wärtsilä propulsion systems in GEV’s compressed hydrogen (C-H2) ships.","['GEV', 'Wärtsilä Marine Power', 'ABS', 'Global Energy Ventures', 'American Bureau of Shipping']","['Martin Carolan', 'Petteri Saares']","['Australia']"

The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies and the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. The three other companies added to the U.S. economic blacklist include Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp (DQ.N); Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based manufacturing giant East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co, part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd (0451.HK). The Commerce Department said the companies and XPCC ""have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in"" Xinjiang. At least some of the companies listed by the Commerce Department are major manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon that are used in solar panel production. The companies or their parent firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment, or could not immediately be reached. XPCC could not immediately be reached for comment. The immediate effect of the restrictions would be limited as the companies named do not have ""vast contracts"" with U.S. based wafer companies, Dennis Ip, Regional Head of Power, Utilities, Renewables & Environment (PURE) Research at Daiwa said in a note to clients. ""However, we see possibility for the ban to gradually extend to include restrictions on all solar modules which contain Xinjiang-produced polysilicon,"" he said. Chinese module producers could still use polysilicon from Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for their U.S.-bound module shipments, he added. About 45% of all polysilicon used in solar module production is produced in Xinjiang, with 35% produced in other parts of China. The remainder comes from outside China. The global solar energy supply chain has been squeezed by record high costs for polysilicon, labour and freight. read more. When asked for comment, China's embassy in Washington referred to remarks on Tuesday by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian who dismissed accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang as ""nothing but rumors with ulterior motives and downright lies."" The ""Withhold Release Order"" by U.S. Customs and Border Protection only blocks imports of the material from Hoshine. A source familiar with the order said it does not impact the majority of U.S. imports of polysilicon and other silica-based products. A second source said the move does not conflict with President Joe Biden's climate goals and support for the domestic solar industry. The Biden administration in March announced a target to cut the cost of solar energy by 60% within the next 10 years. President Biden has set a goal of a 100% clean electricity grid by 2035. The sources said the United States is continuing to investigate allegations of forced labor by Chinese companies who supply polysilicon. The Xinjiang region accounts for approximately 45% of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon supply, a report by solar industry analysts found. The two sources familiar with the policy said the White House sees the actions as a ""natural continuation"" of the G7 agreement earlier this month to eliminate forced labor from supply chains. ""We view these three actions as putting that commitment into action,"" one of the sources said. ""We believe these actions demonstrate a commitment to imposing additional costs on the PRC for engaging in cruel and inhumane forced labor practices."" The XPCC, a paramilitary organization sent to Xinjiang in the 1950s to build farms and settlements, remains powerful in the region's energy and agriculture sectors, operating almost like a parallel state. read more.

The Commerce Department separately added five Chinese entities to the U.S. economic blacklist over forced labor allegations in Xinjiang -- including Hoshine. The White House cited the G7’s recent pledge to clean up the global supply chain as part of its actions. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the import bans on polysilicon and solar products made with forced labor would not hamper the Biden administration’s clean energy goals. “Our environmental goals will not be achieved on the backs of human beings in a forced labor environment,” Mayorkas said at a press briefing. “We’re going to root out forced labor wherever it exists.” The import ban covers products made overseas that use Hoshine materials, including any solar panels produced abroad with polysilicon from Hoshine. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, reacting to earlier reports of the U.S. action, said on Thursday that China would take “all necessary measures” to protect its companies’ rights and interests. Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an interactive investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry’s reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and the impact on its business would be limited. Asked whether the Hoshine ban could be expanded into a region wide ban on all polysilicon from Xinjiang, Mayorkas and CBP officials downplayed any similarities to the agency’s recent region-wide import bans on Xinjiang-produced cotton and tomato products over forced labor. Anna Hinojosa, CBP’s executive director for trade remedy law enforcement, said any expansion would depend on the substantiation of evidence that forced labor is being used. Hinojosa said CBP identified $6 million of direct imports from Hoshine and $150 million of downstream products using Hoshine materials over the past 2.5 years. The United States is also restricting U.S. exports of “commodities, software, and technology” to Hoshine, three other Chinese firms and the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the western Chinese region. The White House said the entities’ practices ran counter not only to American values but also tipped the scales against U.S. workers “by exploiting workers and artificially suppressing wages.” John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the main U.S. solar industry association, said the group fully supported the Biden administration’s move. “The fact is, we do not have transparency into supply chains in the Xinjiang region, and there is too much risk in operating there,” Smirnow said. Polysilicon analyst Johannes Bernreuter with Germany-based Bernreuter Research said the CBP order could have a broad impact on the U.S. solar industry, noting that the world’s top eight polysilicon manufacturers, which produced more than 90% of the solar-grade polysilicon output in 2020, have all been mentioned by Hoshine as customers. “That means they source at least some of their silicon metal needs from Hoshine. Solar panel importers into the U.S. have to prove that the polysilicon for their panels was not made with any silicon metal from Hoshine,” Bernreuter said. The Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics said in a report on Thursday that China accounts for nearly half the global production of polysilicon. ‘PROVE IT’. The new measures are the latest in a series of steps under President Joe Biden to secure U.S. supply chains in the face of allegations of rights abuses in China, and also the growing economic challenges posed by the United States’ top geopolitical rival. Beijing has dismissed accusations of genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang as lies. The three other companies added to the Commerce Department’s blacklist were Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based manufacturing giant East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co, part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd. Several of the companies are major manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon used in solar panel production. Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, in an email to Reuters, said it had “zero tolerance” towards forced labor, and does not directly sell or buy from the United States so there would be no “significant impact” on its business. The other companies or their parent firms, including XPCC, did not reply to requests for comment, or could not be reached. Separately, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act to the full Senate on Thursday. Proposed by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, the bill - should it become law - would ban all products from Xinjiang unless importers could show they were not produced with forced labor. “This is slavery. Simple as that,” Rubio told the committee. “American companies argue that their supply chains are clean, and what this bill says is: prove it.”","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration said Thursday it banned U.S. imports of a key solar panel material from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co, but stopped short of imposing a ban on all imports of silica from Xinjiang and said the action would not harm U.S. clean energy goals.","['Hoshine Silicon Industry Co', 'CBP', 'Commerce Department', 'Senate Foreign Relations Committee', 'Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co', 'Bernreuter Research', 'Biden', 'Chinese', 'East Hope Group', 'G7', 'GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd', 'GCL New Energy Material Co', 'Homeland Security', 'Ministry', 'Peterson Institute for International Economics', 'Reuters', 'Solar Energy Industries Association', 'XPCC', 'Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co', 'Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps']","['Alejandro Mayorkas', 'Anna Hinojosa', 'Johannes Bernreuter', 'John Smirnow', 'Marco Rubio', 'Hoshine', 'Jeff Merkley', 'Joe Biden', 'Zhao Lijian']","['U S', 'Xinjiang', 'United States', 'China', 'Biden', 'White House', 'Beijing', 'Germany-based', 'Shanghai-based', 'WASHINGTON', 'Washington-based']"

The 236-hectare site at Aldoga was chosen for the export-scale facility because if its size and proximity to port, power and pipeline infrastructure, Queensland’s Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Steven Miles, said. Once built, the project would be the largest hydrogen production facility in Queensland. “Stanwell has now signed an option agreement with Economic Development Queensland locking in land for the facility, which is an exciting step towards the proposed project becoming a reality,” Miles said. The state-government expects the project could generate $4.2 billion in hydrogen exports, $10 billion for the Queensland economy, and create more than 5,000 jobs for regional Queenslanders. “We know countries like Japan are looking to the Sunshine State to meet their emissions targets, and in the next decade, Queensland must be ready to capitalise,” Queensland’s Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister, Mick de Brenni, said. “That’s exactly what the Stanwell-Iwatani project will do, scaling up to over 3,000 megawatts of electrolysis capacity by the early 2030s, with millions of tonnes of renewable hydrogen to be exported around the world.” The state-owned Stanwell has undergone a major pivot towards renewables, and in May announced plans for a 150 MW/300 MWh battery adjacent to its 1.4 GW Tarong Power Station in Central Queensland. Stanwell’s acting chief executive, Adam Aspinall, said Stanwell had been investigating hydrogen opportunities since 2018. “We recently completed a joint planning study for the project with Iwatani and we are now building a broader consortium of Japanese and Australian companies to progress the project to the next stage in the second half of 2021,” he said. “As a business, we are progressing a range of future energy solutions to ensure we are in the best position possible to respond to changing market conditions. Aldoga, where the 3 GW facility is to be located, falls into the Gladstone region, which is shaping up to be a major renewable hydrogen export hub and is located nearby the Central Queensland Renewable Energy Zone. In March, London-based Eco Energy World announced plans for a 200 MW green hydrogen plant with 100 MW of energy storage in Gladstone. Just south of the region in Queensland’s Western Downs, the state government, via its state-owned CS Energy, is looking to develop a renewable hydrogen plant next to the Kogan Creek Power Station, in another Japanese partnership – this time with engineering company IHI Corporation. Gladstone also recently joined the National Energy Resources Australia (NERA) network of hydrogen technology clusters, which seeks to seed innovation and productivity by interconnecting players in the hydrogen field.","State-owned electricity generator Stanwell has secured land in Aldoga, west of Gladstone, to build a large-scale 3 GW hydrogen electrolysis plant as part of its partnership with Japan’s Iwatani Corporation, well established in the hydrogen production industry.","['Stanwell', 'Iwatani Corporation', 'CS Energy', 'Eco Energy World', 'Economic Development Queensland', 'Gladstone', 'National Energy Resources Australia']","['Steven Miles', 'Adam Aspinall', 'Mick de Brenni']","['Queensland', 'Gladstone', 'Aldoga', 'Japan', 'Downs', 'London-based', 'Sunshine State']"

Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison may be able to powder his nose with a new compact signed yesterday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G7 Plus Summit in Cornwall yesterday, but the Joint Declaration of Intent (JDOI) to fast-track hydrogen co-operation between the two countries can’t cover his obfuscation on committing to a 2050 deadline for achieving net-zero emissions. Morrison also met with Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga off the official agenda on Sunday and announced “a partnership on decarbonisation through technology”, which focuses on development and commercialisation of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, lower-emissions liquefied natural gas production, clean-fuel ammonia and again, green hydrogen. Suga and Morrison’s joint statement described a technology-led response to climate change as critical to creating jobs and boosting economic growth, but while the statement reaffirmed Japan’s “commitment to transition to net zero emissions by 2050”, Australia reaffirmed its “commitment to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible, preferably by 2050”. In May, Germany brought its pursuit of a net-zero-emissions economy forward, strengthening interim annual targets and declaring a revised deadline of 2045. A statement announcing the German-Australian JDOI said that the demand for emission-free energy would be even greater than Germany’s leaders had previously envisaged. Entities related to the German Fraunhofer Institute, including the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, this month published a joint study which predicted that German demand for green hydrogen will boom to 80 TWh around 2030, to between 100 and 300 TWh in 2040, and reach some 800 TWh in 2050. The study identified that the greatest growth sector of demand for hydrogen and hydrogen-based synthesis products (such as fuel-gas mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) will be industry — with up to 500 TWh of energy required for this German economic powerhouse sector by 2050. “We are in the midst of an unparalleled revolution to decarbonise our industries,” confirmed Christoph von Spesshardt, Executive Director of the German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, yesterday. He added, “This joint declaration is building on an already established partnership between our two like-minded countries and will enable the decarbonisation of German and European industries.” The JDOI provides some added certainty of opportunity for investors in the development of clean hydrogen technology in Australia, where major new hydrogen ventures and commitments are announced at least weekly. In May, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) committed more than $100 million to supporting construction of three large-scale renewable hydrogen plants; east-coast-focused clean energy company Pure Hydrogen is putting all the requirements in place to build the first of four large-scale green hydrogen plants, Project Jupiter, at the port of Gladstone; Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO has committed $68 million to a “Hydrogen Industry Mission” dedicated to driving the cost of local green hydrogen below $2 per kilogram and establish the country as a leader in the global hydrogen economy by 2030; and Queensland electricity generator Stanwell this month partnered with Japan’s Iwatani Corporation and secured 236 hectares of land west of Gladstone to build a 3 GW hydrogen electrolysis plant. “We know countries like Japan are looking to the Sunshine State to meet their emissions targets, and in the next decade, Queensland must be ready to capitalise,” Queensland’s Energy, Renewables and Hydrogen Minister, Mick de Brenni, said last week. Having signed, the JDOI yesterday morning, Morrison told those assembled, that Australia’s “ambition is to produce the cheapest clean hydrogen in the world, which will transform transport, mining, resources and manufacturing at home and overseas”. But already other global emissions-reduction initiatives are threatening the competitiveness of Australia’s products on the world market. On Friday, in advance of the G7 Plus meeting, the Australia Institute Climate & Energy Program published new analysis which shows that the introduction of carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), which is also on the agenda for the gathering of leaders in Cornwall, “will put Australian industry and manufacturing processes — mainly steel, aluminium and alumina — at risk if Australia continues its recalcitrant role on the global stage”. Scott Morrison had indicated he would warn world leaders against the use of carbon tariffs, on the basis that he considers carbon border adjustment mechanisms to be “protectionist”. CBAMs are levies imposed on emissions-intensive imports by countries that themselves implement carbon pricing. The Australia Institute posits that an EU-proposed CBAM, which was to debut at the G7, is “not a tariff, and unlikely to be considered protectionist, as it is designed to comply with World Trade Organisation rules”. This leaves Australia exposed to widespread implementation of CBAMs by countries that are concertedly steering their economies toward zero emissions by 2050 — it’s natural that as they invest in transitioning their industries to low-carbon processes, they will have no desire to support uncommitted freeloaders. Australia remains one of only a few high-income countries that haven’t implemented or plan to implement a carbon price, but whose economies rely on the trading of energy-intensive products that will soon be taxed by more forward-thinking and future-invested countries. Primary metals manufacturing industries are most exposed, says the Australia Institute, which points out that the emissions-intensive alumina and aluminium industries alone produce $12 billion per annum in export revenues for Australia. Economist Nicky Hutley, a spokesperson for the Australian Climate Council, added to the chorus urging more decisive Australian climate action on Friday, “By refusing to set net-zero targets, raise our Paris targets, or stop wasting taxpayer money on fossil fuels, the Australian government is leaving industries like manufacturing, energy and agriculture exposed to costly tariffs … and missing an opportunity to create 250,000 new jobs in the clean economy.” On the positive side, “Carbon border adjustments in destination markets will assist Australia to develop new zero-emission export industries,” says international climate-policy expert Frank Muller, lead author of the Australia Institute report. It’s in Australia’s interests to “engage constructively in the design of CBAMs and invest in clean production methods” for products such as steel and bauxite-to-aluminium processes which are currently heavily reliant on coal or gas for production, says the report. The conclusions of the Australia Institute report authors — “Australia’s natural endowments and human resources position it better than most countries to prosper in a low-carbon world,” says Muller — echo the sentiments of the German-Australian Chamber, which supported negotiations toward the signing of yesterday’s JDOI: “Australia, with its vast assets of renewable energy, is in a prime position to satisfy significant parts” of German industry’s burgeoning demand for green hydrogen. It follows that it has the wherewithal to lead the development of green-metals and other products produced using renewable energy sources. Riche Merzian, Climate & Energy Program Director at the Australia Institute put a warning twist on the Prime Minister’s prevailing narrative when he said in a statement accompanying the Institute’s report, “The Australian Government claims that its approach to climate is dictated by technology, not taxes. Make no mistake, if Australia continues to stonewall its trading partners and allies on climate, the taxes will come anyway” — the revenue will just be collected outside Australia. A hydrogen agreement here, a $600 million gas plant there — such disparate approaches show Australia to be directionless and profligate in its attitude to climate change.","Alliances with Germany and Japan to develop and commercialise emissions-reducing technologies would be a coup for Australia, if there were any concerted efforts at home to reduce emissions in line with international initiatives, and transition Australian industries to be competitive in a carbon-pricing world.","['Australia Institute Climate Energy Program', 'JDOI', 'Fraunhofer Institute for', 'Australian Climate Council', 'Australian Government', 'Australian Renewable Energy Agency', 'CSIRO', 'G7', 'German-Australian Chamber of Industry and Commerce', 'Iwatani Corporation', 'Pure Hydrogen', 'Stanwell', 'World Trade Organisation']","['Scott Morrison', 'Frank Muller', 'Yoshihide Suga', 'Angela Merkel', 'Christoph von Spesshardt', 'Mick de Brenni', 'Nicky Hutley', 'Riche Merzian']","['Australia', 'Japan', 'Cornwall', 'Germany', 'Queensland', 'Gladstone', 'Paris', 'Sunshine State']"

The program’s launch comes amid concern about proposed changes to ARENA’s funding mandate as the Commonwealth Government seeks to expand definitions to include funding for controversial technologies and fossil fuel projects. The Commonwealth-backed Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) on Tuesday launched its Industrial Energy Transformation Studies Program, funded by the 2021 federal budget. With a specific focus on emissions abatement in industry, the program’s funding will be made available to companies and organisations in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas supply, water supply, waste services and data centre sectors. Under the program, applicants can seek $100,000 to $500,000 for feasibility studies or $250,000 to $5 million for engineering studies looking into industrial solutions to improve energy efficiency or greenhouse gas emissions. The first round of the program will see up to $25 million of grant funding being made available to support these studies and establish the business case for replicable projects that demonstrate energy efficiency and decarbonisation technology solutions for industry, ARENA said in its statement. The program is part of the federal government’s Low Emissions Technology Statement which drew criticism when it was released last year because of its support for controversial technologies. In the Low Emissions Technology Statement, Commonwealth Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Angus Taylor, named CCS as one of five priorities that would receive taxpayer support as part of the government’s “technology, not taxes” approach. Also included in the strategy was “clean” hydrogen. Not to be confused with green hydrogen, also called renewable hydrogen, the federal government’s conception of “clean” hydrogen includes hydrogen made with fossil fuels which claim to “capture” its emissions. Off the back of today’s announcement, industry peak body the Clean Energy Council issued a statement again voicing its objections to the government’s proposed mandate changes which would allow the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) to fund ‘low-emission technologies’ like CCS and gas projects. “There is no such thing as clean coal, and gas is not a low-emissions technology,” the Council’s Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said. “Any watering down of the ARENA or CEFC’s investment mandate, allowing them to support higher emissions generation, exposes Australia’s taxpayers to unacceptable risk at a time when an unequivocal message is being sent around the world to back away from publicly-funded fossil fuel projects,” he added. On Friday, Monash University published new analysis in conjunction with the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science showing Australia to be a “green laggard.” The analysis found Australia’s green competitiveness has fallen significantly over the past 20 years. It is now rated 96th of the 231 countries the universities analysed. “Of the countries considered, Australia appears to be in the least favourable starting position to competitively export products with environmental benefits. Australia is cited to have just 12 ‘green strengths’ compared to 59 in Canada and 153 in China,” the report ‘Navigating the green transition: insights for the G7’ said. Australia’s straggler status is becoming increasingly glaring as climate action has recently risen to the top of international agendas following net-zero commitments from superpowers the United States and China. Which is why the proposed changes to funding rules for both ARENA and CEFC have stirred such panic, diluting the goals of the few institutions the country has specifically for green energy. Applications for the initial round of ARENA’s Industrial Energy Transformation Studies Program will open on July 6, 2021.","The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) today announced the launch of its $43 million program aimed at identifying how to reduce emissions in industry.

Last night, the Senate defeated the Morrison government’s attempt to expand the remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to include funding non-renewable projects. Energy Minister Angus Taylor’s plan was to expand the scope of ARENA to fund carbon capture and storage projects and hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Moreover, the Coalition also saw projects in the heavy transport, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas supply, water supply, waste services and data centre sectors that would also profit from tearing ARENA limb from limb. Thankfully, the Labor Party, the Greens and cross bench Senators combined forces to block Taylor’s proposed changes in what Smart Energy Council (SEC) chief executive John Grimes called “a big win for the renewables industry and a big defeat for Angus Taylor and the Morrison Government!” “These changes were illegal” Grimes added, “they were against ARENA’s founding Act of Parliament – and we were ready to take the Government to court on this issue.” “Renewable energy bodies should fund renewable energy projects,” Grimes said finally, “it’s that simple.” Labor’s Shadow Minister for Climate and Energy, Chris Bowen, took to Twitter to share the good news: According to The Guardian, the tide on the initial vote was turned when Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson returned to the chamber having missed the vote because of a “dicky hip”. With Whish-Wilson safely seated, and Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff’s absentee vote accounted for, the vote was retaken and Taylor’s subterfuge disallowed 28 votes to 27. Greens leader Adam Bandt said in a celebratory tweet that the vote was “Huge” and “public money should go to schools, hospitals and renewables, not coal and gas.” Bandt went on to agree with Grimes in calling the victory a “massive blow to this coal and gas-fired government…First the Liberals tried to abolish ARENA and then redirect its funds to coal and gas, but by backing the Greens motion, the Senate has just saved ARENA…A lesson here is that when we fight this coal and gas-fired Liberal government, we can win.”","In a big win for renewables and a big loss for the Morrison Government, the Senate has blocked the Energy Minister Angus Taylor’s attempt to illegally expand the mandate of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to fund non-renewable projects.","['Senate', 'ARENA…A', 'Greens', 'Morrison Government', 'Australian Renewable Energy Agency', 'Labor Party', 'Centre Alliance', 'Smart Energy Council', 'The Guardian']","['Angus Taylor', 'John Grimes', 'Adam Bandt', 'Peter Whish-Wilson', 'Chris Bowen', 'Stirling Griff']","[]"

The Morrison government’s plan to expand the scope of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) so it can fund non-renewable energy projects has come under increased scrutiny with a parliamentary committee questioning whether it is legal. Taylor has moved to expand the mandate of ARENA to allow it to fund carbon capture and storage projects and hydrogen that can be produced from fossil fuels. Projects in the heavy transport, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, gas supply, water supply, waste services and data centre sectors could also be funded. Taylor said the changes are designed to make technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen commercially competitive to reduce emissions “without destroying industries or jobs”. The proposed change has attracted criticism from the Labor Party while Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton said it will injects uncertainty into what needs to be a clear and strong economic signal for an orderly transition away from fossil fuels. “There is no such thing as clean coal, and gas is not a low-emissions technology,” he said. The Smart Energy Council has also voiced its opposition, declaring in a tweet it will fight the proposed changes which have now attracted the focus of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation. In a letter to Energy Minister Angus Taylor, the Senate committee’s chair, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, expressed concern that his plan to use regulation rather than legislation to expand ARENA’s remit could be illegal. The Liberal senator wrote to Taylor on Thursday, noting the objective of the laws governing ARENA were “to improve the competitiveness and supply of renewable energy in Australia”. “The legislated functions of the ARENA are limited to supporting renewable energy technologies,” she wrote. “There is nothing in the … Act to suggest that it was contemplated that the ARENA would have the ability to foster anything other than renewable energy technologies.” Fierravanti-Wells said the committee believed “given the scope and impact of the measures”, they were more appropriate for parliamentary enactment rather than regulation, or delegated legislation. “The committee therefore requests your advice as to why it is considered necessary and appropriate to use delegated legislation, rather than primary legislation, to expand the remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to include non-renewable energy technologies,” she wrote. Fierravanti-Wells called on Taylor to explain the move by July 1, suggesting the committee could move a motion to disallow the change in the Senate if he did not respond. Labor’s climate spokesperson Chris Bowen told parliament on Tuesday he believed the change could be illegal, saying the “the giveaway” was in the agency’s name. “The ‘r’ in ARENA stands for renewable,” he said. “It’s in the act, as the objective of the act, and it’s a pretty clear principle under other legislation that a regulation cannot conflict with the legislated act.” Bowen said Labor supports any new energy technologies that stack up scientifically and commercially but said deserving non-renewable technologies should be supported in other ways and not allowed to dilute ARENA’s funding and expertise. “Even the minister’s explanatory statement on the new regulations admits that ARENA’s legislated functions are currently limited to supporting renewable energy technologies,” Bowen said. “Changing those functions would require legislation – not a cynical attempt to circumvent the parliament via regulations.”","Legal doubts have emerged about the Morrison government’s proposed change for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which would allow it to finance a broader range of technologies including some using fossil fuels.","['ARENA', 'Australian Renewable Energy Agency', 'Labor Party', 'Morrison', 'Senate', 'Taylor', 'Clean Energy Council', 'Smart Energy Council', 'Standing Committee']","['Angus Taylor', 'Chris Bowen', 'Concetta Fierravanti-Wells', 'Kane Thornton']","['Australia']"
"https://www.reuters.com/article/climate-change-reinsurance-coal/focus-reinsurers-look-at-dumping-coal-from-bulk-buy-policies-in-green-gambit-idUSL5N2N61PR","https://www.reuters.com/","Reinsurers look at dumping coal from bulk-buy policies in green gambit","2021-06-17 06:11:00","LONDON (Reuters) - Major reinsurers have already pulled back from providing bespoke cover for coal projects as part of efforts to meet global climate change commitments, but now comes the hard part - finding ways to exclude coal from bulk-buy contracts, known as “treaty” reinsurance. Reinsurance companies help to share the burden of insurance risks by underwriting frontline insurers. Any restrictions they impose will have a knock-on impact on insurance policies on offer to companies. Most reinsurers have stepped back from offering insurers bespoke or direct cover for coal projects, but many still underwrite the industry through treaty reinsurance, where hundreds of insurers’ policies are bundled together. The process of unbundling treaty reinsurance to search for coal exposure is tough, yet pressure is building on the industry from investors and regulators to do more to reflect the growing risks of climate change in how they underwrite. Swiss Re is already doing this. If more reinsurers do cut back this cover, specialist commercial insurers such as those operating in the Lloyd’s of London market will feel the impact, as will suppliers to the coal industry or those businesses which derive even a small portion of their revenues from coal. “The first consequence is insurance is harder to get, the second consequence is it’s expensive, the third consequence is there are all sorts of caveats on it and at the extreme you might not be offered it”, said Paul Merrey, insurance partner at KPMG.A rail contractor to Adani Enterprises’ giant Australian coal project last month, for example, asked the Australian government for help to obtain insurance that it was not able to secure from the market. Five of the world’s six largest reinsurers - Swiss Re, Munich Re, Hannover Re, SCOR and Lloyd’s of London - have already scaled back bespoke coverage for coal projects. But only Swiss Re, in a statement in March, has said it will go further and tighten its treaty reinsurance stance. Munich Re and Hannover Re told Reuters they are working with their insurance clients to cut their own exposure further. “We want to keep the dialogue and push for change together,” said Jean-Jacques Henchoz, chief executive of Hannover Re, though he added that: “It’s not happening in a couple of weeks, it’s taking a bit of time.” Munich Re and Hannover Re said they were working out how to assess what was inside their treaty reinsurance books. “For coal we are very confident that this is something we will get transparency on, but of course it’s much more difficult than doing it for the direct and facultative business,” said Michael Menhart, head of economics, sustainability and public affairs at Munich Re. Facultative refers to single risk cover. Lloyd’s of London, which has around 100 syndicate members and launched a strategy on coal for the first time last year, said by email that it would be producing further guidance later this year. Scor did not respond to a request for comment. For the global reinsurance industry as a whole, treaty reinsurance typically makes up the majority of business in the $500-billion-plus market, industry sources say. Swiss Re has said it will introduce thermal coal exposure thresholds in its treaty business with insurers as a first step towards full phase-out by 2040, though it has not yet specified the thresholds. “We worked internally with the treaty desks around the world to understand their coal exposures,” said Martin Weymann, head of sustainability, emerging and political risk management at Swiss Re. “We took quite a bit of time to filter out which risks are most exposed.” Henchoz at Hannover Re said in terms of excluding coal from treaty business, it was important to scratch below the surface and try to be very concrete on how to achieve an official target. Lloyd’s, which industry sources say tends to be more cautious about taking steps on climate than the major European reinsurers, said its syndicate members were moving away from fossil fuels. Lloyd’s said the market wanted “to ensure that existing customers have time to transition their businesses and that we don’t create unnecessary cliff edges”. Pressure group ShareAction said in a recent report that the fact that treaty reinsurance can provide cover for coal risked undermining the progress being made through restricting bespoke cover. Even if more of the major reinsurers move to stop treaty cover of coal, the impact could take some time to fully work its way through the system, as other reinsurers look to take up the slack. “In the short term, there might be some opportunistic players,” said Swiss Re’s Weymann, adding, however, that shareholders were leading the pressure for longer-term change. Isabelle Santenac, global insurance leader at EY, however, said that rather than exclusion, the industry should instead use its influence to engage with corporate clients to help them to make the transition more quickly to a greener economy. “If you stop working for those companies, those companies will find another insurer to underwrite that risk, and then you can say ‘what has changed for the planet? Nothing’.”","LONDON (Reuters) - Major reinsurers have already pulled back from providing bespoke cover for coal projects as part of efforts to meet global climate change commitments, but now comes the hard part - finding ways to exclude coal from bulk-buy contracts, known as “treaty” reinsurance.","['Lloyd of London', 'Swiss Re', 'Hannover Re', 'Munich Re', 'Adani Enterprises’', 'EY', 'KPMG A', 'Reuters', 'SCOR', 'Scor', 'ShareAction']","['Jean-Jacques Henchoz', 'Martin Weymann', 'Isabelle Santenac', 'Michael Menhart', 'Paul Merrey']","['LONDON']"

A consultation has opened on the plans for The Old Shipyard site at Arklow Harbour.","2021-06-07 09:48:00","SSE Renewables has unveiled plans for an operations and maintenance facility at Arklow Harbour for the 520MW second phase of the Arklow Bank offshore wind farm off Ireland. The base is proposed for the South Dock in Arklow Harbour and SSE is inviting the public to share views during a public consultation that runs from 7 to 25 June. The facility will act as the support base for the offshore wind farm over its operational lifetime. It will require an expected investment of around €15m, the company said. SSE Renewables is proposing to develop the facility at a disused site known as The Old Shipyard. Approximately 60 construction roles will be created during the delivery phase of the O&M facility alone, and additional indirect supply chain roles are expected. Once complete, the building will accommodate around 80 full-time employees who will be recruited to work on the wind farm once it becomes operational. These direct jobs will include site managers, supervisors, technicians, control room operators, engineers, vessel crew, stores and administration staff. The wider wind farm will also support thousands of indirect and induced jobs over the project’s lifetime, SSE said. The four-storey development has been designed to be a ‘Nearly Zero Energy Building’, meaning the building will operate to a very high energy performance, the company said. It will accommodate warehousing for turbine components, office and meeting space and staff welfare facilities. Plans are also in place to provide a sustainable development centre on the top floor overlooking the Harbour that will anchor the facility in the community and welcome visitors for educational tours, exhibitions and sustainability-themed events. Urban realm improvements are also planned for the site including landscaping and improved public lighting. The nearshore element of the plans will see the existing disused syncrolift removed from the Harbour’s dockside and replaced with berthing and pontoon facilities for crew transfer vessels. SSE Renewables will lodge a planning application with Wicklow County Council later this summer for the proposed development. The consultation will provide an opportunity for members of the public and stakeholders to engage with SSE Renewables on its plans and submit feedback to further inform the development of the facility. Arklow Bank Wind Park project manager James O’Hara said: “We are delighted to share plans for the operations and maintenance facility which will act as the support base for Arklow Bank Wind Park Phase 2. “This state-of-the-art building will play a crucial role in kick-starting the regeneration of Arklow Harbour. “It is also from this building where 80 full-time employees will be based for decades to come. “I encourage the local community to share feedback on this element of the project so we can refine our plans accordingly before we seek planning approval later this year.” Dublin-based Studio Negri was commissioned to design the O&M base. Studio Negri Architect and Founder Andre Negri said: “I was delighted to have the opportunity to work on the Arklow Bank Wind Park phase 2, which is a trailblazing project, both onshore and offshore. “Inspired by Arklow’s credentials as a decarbonisation zone, we wanted to ensure the operations and maintenance facility is designed to deliver a high-performing, state-of-the-art facility, with minimum impact on the environment, and powered by renewable energy sources. “The social element of the facility has also been carefully considered. “The building will be engaging for users and the community with spaces for people to work, but also to gather and collaborate.”","SSE Renewables has unveiled plans for an operations and maintenance facility at Arklow Harbour for the 520MW second phase of the Arklow Bank offshore wind farm off Ireland.","['SSE Renewables', 'Studio Negri', 'Wicklow County Council']","['Andre Negri', 'James O’Hara']","['Arklow Harbour', 'Dublin-based', 'Ireland']"

Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV) has confirmed work has begun on its $60 million Dalby Hybrid Power Plant which will comprise 2.4 MW of solar PV capacity and a 2.5 MW/5 MWh battery, making it the first battery energy storage system (BESS) the company has developed in Australia. FRV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Abdul Latif Jameel, said the plant’s output will be connected to Ergon’s distribution network, allowing it to supply and take electricity from the grid and trade in the National Electricity Market (NEM). FRV Australia managing director Carlo Frigerio said the hybrid facility is designed to be operated as a predictable and dispatchable generation plant, providing a reliable energy output to Queensland customers. The company said the system will have the ability to access the maximum number of markets and revenue streams, including arbitrage and frequency control ancillary services (FCAS). “Battery energy storage systems are needed to support further investment in Queensland renewables and help maintain system security and reliability,” Frigerio said. “This project will be critical to Queensland’s future energy supply and security as renewable energy capacity increases, with storage supporting solar and wind power coming into the market when it is most needed. “The inclusion of PV as part of the project shows the importance of integrating solar and batteries in order to deliver dispatchable power.” Construction of the project is scheduled to be completed in December with the facility expected to be fully operational by early 2022. FRV global managing director Felipe Hernandez said the Dalby project is part of the company’s long-term investment plan to develop energy storage projects globally. “FRV is already collaborating with governments, regulators, and partners around the world to lay the foundations for a new energy model,” he said. “Energy storage will play a central and critical role to fully realise the power of renewable energy, and FRV acknowledges the value of this technology as a key element to achieve a decarbonised society.” The Dalby Hybrid Power Plant is FRV’s ninth project in operation or under construction across the NEM, including the 125 MW Lilyvale Solar Farm in Queensland, the 106 MW Winton Solar Farm in Victoria, and the 69.75 MW Goonumbla Solar Farm in New South Wales. FRV has also achieved financial close on the 115 MW Metz Solar Farm, commenced construction on the 90 MW Sebastopol Solar Farm, and continues to develop the 300 MW Walla Walla Solar Farm, all in NSW.

Turkey is open to the option of drilling another exploratory well in the Black Sea this year following the discovery on Friday of 135 billion cubic meters of gas in the Amasra-1 well, Turkey’s Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Donmez said Monday. Speaking at the fourth Turkey Energy and Natural Resources Summit, Donmez said thanks to gas discoveries totaling 540 billion cubic meters (bcm) so far, Turkey is on its way to becoming a natural gas producing country rather than a consuming country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the discovery of 135 bcm of gas on Friday, bringing the country's gas discoveries in the Black Sea up to 540 bcm. This follows on from the largest offshore gas discovery in the world and the second-largest in overall discoveries last year of 405 bcm in the Tuna-1 well located in the Sakarya gas field, around 170 kilometers off the Black Sea. ""Currently, our friends continue to work at the northeast of Sakarya Gas Field, in Amasra-1 well. With the [recent] discovery announced in that field, perhaps this year we can open another exploratory well in the south and west of this area,"" he said. He is optimistic that additional resources will be found in the region to cover Turkey's residential power consumption for at least 25 years. ""In a field on such a scale, we can project a production and operation plan for 25 years on average. So we can speak about 15 to 20 bcm of natural gas production per year at maximum levels,"" he explained. With Turkey's large energy import bill reaching $40 billion on average over the last 10 years, Donmez stressed the importance of decreasing import dependency. - The Eastern Mediterranean. The results from eight drillings in the Eastern Mediterranean, however, have not matched the successes in the Black Sea so far although evaluations on the more positive results are currently taking place, Donmez said. The energy minister also pressed on the mutual benefits of an agreement on maritime jurisdictions with Egypt, which to date has only indirect contact but lacked energy ministry communication. ""If conditions are suitable, there might be some contacts,"" he said. He also touched on Turkey’s renewable energy expansion through Renewable Energy Resource Zone (YEKA) tenders that aim to install 10,000 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind energy each by 2023. Turkey will administer 2,000 MW of YEKA tenders for wind and 1,000 MW for solar this year, Donmez said, adding that the mining sector also shows much promise with forecast mining exports this year expected in the region between $5 and $5.5 billion.

The inauguration ceremony of Turkey's first publicly-owned floating LNG storage and gasification vessel (FSRU) ""Ertugrul Gazi"" will be held on June 25, presided over by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Donmez announced on Wednesday. Speaking at the Yeni Akit Daily Energy and Mining Council in Ankara, Donmez said Ertugrul Gazi would be the first FSRU ship to fly the Turkish flag. The Ertugrul Gazi FSRU is owned by Turkey’s state-owned crude oil and natural gas pipelines and trading company, Botas. It will connect to facilities in the southern Hatay province and meet the household energy demand for one year of Hatay and Osmaniye provinces, having a natural gas storage capacity of 110 million standard cubic meters. - Solar energy breaks record in May. Donmez also spoke of Turkey's ongoing efforts to add more renewables and local energy resources to its energy mix through public and private sector cooperation along with collaboration with universities. ""We managed to break several records in renewable energy in 2021 when 96.8% of installed capacity that came online in the first five months of the year came from renewable resources,"" he said. By the end of May, renewables constituted 52.6% of Turkey's total installed capacity and local resources constituted 64.2%, while 56% of electricity production came from local resources, he said. ""The share of wind energy in total installed capacity reached 9.9% and Turkey is getting closer to 10,000 megawatts of installed capacity in wind step by step,"" he underlined. In May, Turkey broke a monthly solar energy record when the country produced 1,468 gigawatt-hours of solar power, marking a 5.8% share of overall power production. - Mining contribution to economy quadruples. Donmez said mining has quadrupled its contribution to Turkey's gross domestic product over the past 10 years, reaching 46.7 million Turkish liras from nearly 11-12 billion liras. This mining share now stands at 1.1%, but according to Donmez, this will increase in the coming years. The share of mining out of total exports reached 2.52% from 2.39% a year ago, showing the sector's resilience to tough conditions like Covid-19, he said.

The agreement covers the Equinor Refining Denmark A/S (ERD) company consisting of the Kalundborg refinery and terminal in the northwest of Zealand, the Hedehusene terminal near Copenhagen as well as associated infrastructure and industrial property. Upon completion of the transaction, including approval by Danish authorities, all ERD employees will be transferred to the Klesch Group with equitable employment terms as within Equinor. “This transaction supports Equinor’s strategy to focus its portfolio around core areas. Equinor will concentrate its refining position around Mongstad, Norway, where the company can leverage its integrated industrial cluster, expand the portfolio of low carbon energy products provided and contribute to Equinor’s efforts in the energy transition. Over the years, Kalundborg has provided solid results and strong efforts have been made to maintain safe and reliable operations, also with the recent challenges caused by the pandemic” says Irene Rummelhoff, Equinor’s executive vice president for Marketing, Midstream and Processing. The Klesch Group has been in refining for over 10 years and is well positioned to take the business further. In a statement, A. Gary Klesch, the Chairman of the Klesch Group, says: “I am so pleased that we were able to reach an agreement today to purchase the Kalundborg refinery from Equinor. The refinery is first class and so are its people. It was challenging during the covid pandemic to undertake this acquisition, but through the hard work of both my team and Equinor’s team, we were able to get there in the end. Given the proximity of our refinery in Germany, I’m sure there will be lots of opportunities for both refineries to work together; especially when it comes to deploying our decarbonisation strategy”. The Kalundborg refinery was built in 1961 and was acquired by Equinor in 1986 before significantly increasing capacity in 1995. The plant can process 107,000 barrels a day of crude oil and condensate for gasoline, diesel, propane and heating oil. Annual production capacity is up to 5.5 million tonnes of oil products. Completion will, among other things, be dependent on approval by the Danish authorities. Further commercial details on the transaction will not be disclosed. The two refineries, Kalundborg and Mongstad, are independent and separate enterprises, with separate markets and largely their own competence bases.

"https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/18/environment-minister-threatens-shake-up-for-module-manufacturers/","https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/","Environment minister threatens shake-up for module manufacturers","2021-06-18 03:40:14","Solar PV module manufacturers have been put on notice with Environment Minister Sussan Ley warning they need to formulate a recycling strategy as the growing number of decommissioned panels threatens a waste management nightmare. Environment Minister Sussan Ley has directed solar PV module manufacturers to produce a “clear timeline” for establishing an industry wide recycling strategy for end-of-life technology with the government determined to avoid a looming “landfill nightmare”. Speaking at the National Press Club this week, Ley said government is concerned that Australia’s record rollout of solar PV will eventually generate a huge pipeline of waste and a solution is needed now. “I am putting the solar panel industry on notice with clear timelines for action,” she said. “The uptake of millions of solar panels across the country from rooftops to solar farms has been vital from an emissions perspective but the explosion of retailers and importers in the area, and the lack of an industry wide approach to collection and recycling, means that it also looms as a landfill nightmare. “We can’t fix one environmental issue by creating another.” Australia has embraced solar PV, with 2 GW of new large-scale solar generation capacity added to the grid in 2020 while a record 3 GW of rooftop solar PV capacity was installed nationally last year. All indications are for another bumper year in 2021 with the Clean Energy Council predicting another 3.5 to 4 GW of rooftop capacity will be installed while large-scale solar also continues at pace. The lifespan of a solar module can be anywhere from 10 to 25 years, and while some industry figures have calculated that average solar module in Australia is three-years old, the number of panels nearing the end of life is about to grow exponentially. Currently, almost all broken or expired solar panels in Australia go into landfill and researchers from the University of South Australia (UniSA) have estimated that more than 100,000 tonnes of solar modules will enter the waste stream by 2035. The government has been pushing the industry to develop a plan for the past six years, and Ley is expected to next week list solar modules on the government’s stewardship priority list – which already mandates how electronic waste, like televisions, is dealt with – to force a recycling solution. A spokesperson from Ley’s office said a “product stewardship scheme for photovoltaic systems should encourage shared responsibility throughout the supply chain”. “Designers, manufacturers, installers and retailers all have a responsibility to manage the impacts of their products through their life cycle,” the spokesperson said. Clive Fleming, director of Adelaide-based Reclaim PV Recycling has previously called for a national approach to what he said looms as a growing issue. “Research is suggesting that there will be more than 1 million panels requiring replacement annually by 2031,” he said. “We need a nation-wide approach to managing the replacement and recycling of faulty, non-performing and end-of-life solar panels before this gets unmanageable and we start to see 2,000 tonnes of waste making its way to landfill annually.” Fleming, who recently secured approval to establish a second facility in Brisbane, said current recycling options are expensive – the cost to recycle one solar panel with Reclaim PV about $10 plus freight charges to the facility. Solar panels are 100% recyclable but stripping and sorting the materials is a costly exercise and the return on those materials isn’t yet large enough to cover those costs. “We do need to charge at the moment for the recycling because the amount of solar panels coming in isn’t huge,” Fleming said. “Until that tipping point comes where we can sell our materials in a larger volume, it means that we still have to charge for the process and our labour.” Fleming said what would help keep solar modules from landfill was if more states and territories followed Victoria’s lead and banned them from being dumped. The New South Wales government has made moves to address the situation, allocating $10 million for a two-stage grant funding scheme aimed at keeping end-of-life solar systems out of landfill.","Solar PV module manufacturers have been put on notice with Environment Minister Sussan Ley warning they need to formulate a recycling strategy as the growing number of decommissioned panels threatens a waste management nightmare.","['Clean Energy Council', 'National Press Club', 'Reclaim PV Recycling', 'University of South Australia']","['Sussan Ley', 'Clive Fleming']","['Australia', 'Adelaide-based', 'Brisbane', 'New South Wales', 'Victoria']"

From pv magazine Australia. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government has decided to investigate new recycling options and a product stewardship scheme for solar PV modules, inverters and batteries, after a motion was passed in the nation's legislative assembly earlier this week. The motion calls for the ACT government to explore new recycling options for a range of electrical appliances, including solar PV modules, inverters and large batteries. The government will also be expected to produce a report outlining options and a timeline by February 2022. Figures provided by the federal government show that 2,700 tons of solar PV waste was generated in Australia in 2018 as the earliest modules reached their end of life. By 2050, it is expected that figure will climb to 1,532,000 tons of PV waste per year. The ACT government’s announcement came just hours after federal environment minister Sussan Ley told the solar industry that it needs to design and present a finalized industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022. She said waste from solar systems looms as an environmental disaster, and has said that the nationwide scheme must be operational by June 2023. The program will also include an approach to deal with legacy panels. Ley said previous submissions from sections of the industry to set up a scheme have lacked a cohesive, coordinated and sustainable approach that looked beyond initial support from the government. “Solar panels have languished on the government’s priority list for six years now. It is time for the industry to step up and address the issue of waste either stockpiling or ending up in landfill, and today I have given them a deadline of mid-2022 to do that,” she said. Ley’s announcement triggered a swift response from the Clean Energy Council (CEC), which said it is “frustrated” with the federal government’s approach to solar module waste. CEC Chief Executive Kane Thornton said that the peak body has worked to develop a plan to address this issue over the past year. But the federal government has walked away from coordinating a national approach to solar PV waste, he claimed. Another proposal put forward by the CEC to establish an industry-led and self-funded product stewardship program was also rejected, he added. “Industry is prepared to lead and coordinate this initiative, but it also requires coordination and leadership from government given the significant regulatory interactions between the three tiers of government on environment and waste policy,” Thornton said. “We would welcome a joint approach from the federal government and we remain ready, willing and able to work in partnership with them on this significant issue.” Industry has already made moves to address the issue, as the number of decommissioned modules mounts up. Victoria-based Lotus Energy, for example, has commenced recycling operations at its facility in Melbourne.

The ACT government will investigate recycling options and a product stewardship scheme for solar PV modules, inverters and batteries after a motion was passed in the Legislative Assembly earlier this week. The motion calls for the ACT government to explore recycling options for a range of electrical appliances including solar PV modules, inverters and large batteries and for a report outlining options and a timeline to be presented to the Assembly by February 2022. The motion, put forward on Wednesday by Greens MLA Jo Clay, will also seek to confirm which of the products will be covered by a product stewardship scheme to commence within the next 12 months. Clay said solar PV uptake in the ACT is at an all-time high and a product stewardship scheme would place the onus for end-of-life recycling on the manufacturer or industry. This is a really good way to recycle, as it means the producers have an incentive to design easy-to-recover material and it also means they include the cost of recycling in the original purchase price, Clay said. Figures provided by the federal government show that 2,700 tonnes of solar PV waste was generated in Australia in 2018 as the earliest modules reached their end of life. By 2050 it is expected that figure will climb to 1,532,000 tonnes of PV waste annually. “We need to make it simple to recycle solar panels, large batteries and electrical products,” Clay said. “The Victorian government banned solar panels and e-waste from landfill in July 2019 and are leading the way on this nationally. “This motion will pull the ACT in line with community expectations on recycling of electrical products. It is a necessary step in the ACT’s continued journey towards an environmentally sustainable future.” The ACT government’s announcement came just hours after federal environment minister Sussan Ley informed the solar industry it needs to design and present a finalised industry-led product stewardship scheme by June 2022. Following her speech in the National Press Club last week during which she said waste from solar systems looms as an environmental disaster, the minister announced on Tuesday the nationwide scheme must be operational by June 2023 and include an approach to deal with legacy panels. Ley said previous submissions from sections of the industry to set up a scheme have lacked a cohesive, coordinated and sustainable approach that looked beyond initial support from the government. “Solar panels have languished on the government’s priority list for six years now. It is time for the industry to step up and address the issue of waste either stockpiling or ending up in landfill, and today I have given them a deadline of mid-2022 to do that,” she said. Ley’s announcement triggered a swift response from the Clean Energy Council (CEC) which said it was “frustrated” with the federal government’s approach to solar module waste. CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said the peak body has worked to develop a plan to address this issue over the past year but the federal government had walked away from coordinating a national approach to solar PV waste. Thornton said another proposal put forward by the CEC to establish an industry-led and self-funded product stewardship program was also rejected. “Industry is prepared to lead and coordinate this initiative, but it also requires coordination and leadership from government given the significant regulatory interactions between the three tiers of government on environment and waste policy,” he said. “We would welcome a joint approach from the federal government and we remain ready, willing and able to work in partnership with them on this significant issue.” Industry has already made moves to address the issue as the number of decommissioned modules mounts up with Adelaide-based Reclaim PV Recycling recently securing approval to establish a second facility in Brisbane. Reclaim PV, which for the past few years has been processing a test trickle of around 10,000 modules per annum, is looking to work with manufacturers, councils and businesses to establish a national network of drop-off locations for solar modules to be recycled at its plants. Victorian-based Lotus Energy has also commenced recycling operations at its facility in Melbourne’s north, unveiling its panel-crushing plant earlier this year, declaring it is capable of recycling 100% of end-of-life solar modules, including inverters, cables, optimisers and mounting structures – all without using any chemicals. Sydney-based PV Industries has also started recycling solar modules and processing material after securing a site in the city’s western suburbs earlier this year. The New South Wales government has also made moves to address the challenge, allocating $10 million for a two-stage grant funding scheme aimed at keeping end-of-life solar systems out of landfill.","The federal government’s revelation of a deadline for the solar industry to “step up” and address the growing issue of solar PV module waste or face regulation has coincided with the Australian Capital Territory government announcing plans to investigate recycling options for solar panels.","['ACT', 'CEC', 'Legislative Assembly', 'Reclaim PV Recycling', 'Australian Capital Territory', 'Clean Energy Council', 'Greens', 'Lotus Energy', 'National Press Club', 'PV Industries']","['Jo Clay', 'Sussan Ley', 'Kane Thornton']","['Adelaide-based', 'Australia', 'Brisbane', 'Melbourne', 'New South Wales', 'Sydney-based']"

Newly founded Technip Energies is providing the facility to BP for deployment on the maritime border of Mauritania and Senegal as part of the GTA project. Under the contract, Havfram will project manage, engineer, transport, and install the driven piles and corresponding mooring lines. The company will later return to hook up the pre-installed mooring system to the FPSO on its arrival in the field. The FPSO will be stationed 35 kilometers from shore in a circa 120-meter water depth. Work on the project has already commenced, with the project management and engineering team based in Havfram’s Aberdeen office in the UK. “The Greater Tortue Ahmeyim FPSO Mooring Pre-Lay and Hook-up project is another significant mooring project award in what is a core business line for Havfram. This award further enhances our already strong track record in complex mooring projects and we are proud to have been chosen by Technip Energies for their award of such a significant project,” said Odd Strømsnes, Havfram CEO. Havfram is also currently contracted for similar critical start-up processes for the Johan Castberg and Jotun FPSO on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. BP reached the final investment decision for Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim back in December 2018. The project will produce gas from an ultra-deepwater subsea system and mid-water FPSO vessel, which will process the gas, removing heavier hydrocarbon components. The gas will then be transferred to a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility at a nearshore hub located on the Mauritania and Senegal maritime border. The integrated gas value chain and nearshore LNG development will export LNG to global markets, as well as supplying gas to Senegal and Mauritania.","Havfram has secured a contract with Technip Energies for the pre-installation and hook-up of the subsea mooring system for the natural gas floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) at the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) project.","['Havfram', 'Technip Energies', 'BP']","['Odd Strømsnes']","['Senegal', 'Mauritania', 'Aberdeen', 'UK']"

"https://www.offshore-energy.biz/mocean-energy-kicks-off-blue-x-sea-trials-at-emec/","https://www.offshore-energy.biz/","Mocean Energy kicks off Blue X sea trials at EMEC","2021-06-14 00:00:00","Scottish company Mocean Energy has started testing its Blue X wave energy prototype at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney. In the last few days, the 20-metre long, 38-tonne wave machine has been towed from Kirkwall to EMEC’s Scapa Flow test site where it has been successfully moored and commissioned for initial sea trials. Later this summer, the Blue X will be moved to EMEC’s grid connected wave test site at Billia Croo on the west coast of Orkney, where it will go through its paces in more rigorous full sea conditions. Cameron McNatt, Mocean Energy’s managing director, said: “This is a very exciting moment as we put our first prototype to test at sea. Following successful installation on Friday, Blue X generated its first power and continued to generate power, charging batteries, throughout the weekend”. According to McNatt, during the Scapa testing phase, Mocean Energy will test power production, and compare results against the numerical predictions, while also testing operations including towing, installation, removal, and access at sea. The device is standalone and operated wirelessly, with 4G connection enabled for sending commands and downloading data from shore. “I’d like to thank all of our local Orkney-based partners including EMEC, Leask Marine, Heddles, Orkney Harbour Authority and Orcades Marine for the help we have received to date. “We believe our technology is ideally suited to a number of offshore operations, where it can make a direct contribution to net zero goals. Longer-term, we think grid-scale machines will be able to tap into deep ocean waves to generate significant quantities of clean energy”, McNatt concluded. Next year, Mocean Energy plans to connect the device to a subsea battery which will be used to power a remotely operated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) – with potential applications offshore. The deployment and demonstration of the Blue X at EMEC is being funded by Wave Energy Scotland and supported by Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project. Tim Hurst, managing director of Wave Energy Scotland, said: “This test programme coincides with the real prospect of a UK market support mechanism for marine energy, which could enable Britain’s wave and tidal sector to take a global lead at a time when the whole world is seeking new ways to create a net zero future. “This is technology developed right here in Scotland, supported by a mature UK supply chain that can exploit the huge global market potential for wave energy and bring significant economic benefits”. To remind, EMEC launched a consultation process for stakeholders and the members of public on a decommissioning programme for Blue X as part of the mandatory consenting process.

Mocean Energy Managing Director Cameron McNatt said, “This is a significant moment for Mocean Energy as our first prototype moves towards operations at sea – where all of our computer modeling, design and engineering will be put to the test. “Our program at EMEC will allow us to prove our concept at sea, particularly that its novel hull shapes will produce more power than traditional raft designs. “We are working with Orkney-based partners including EMEC, Leask Marine, Heddles, Orkney Harbour Authority, and Orcades Marine, each of which has significant experience in testing at sea and operating in Orkney, and we very much look forward to learning with them. “This demonstration of credible wave technology is the culmination of years of work, and I am extremely grateful to Wave Energy Scotland for providing the funding and support which has allowed us to reach this point, and to the Ocean DEMO project for supporting the demonstration at EMEC. “Our test program coincides with the real prospect of a UK market support mechanism for marine energy, which could enable Scotland’s wave and tidal sector to take a global lead at a time when the whole word is seeking new ways to create a net zero future.” Neil Kermode, Manging Director at EMEC said, “A very warm welcome to the Mocean Energy team to Orkney. We are looking forward to supporting Mocean’s testing program here at EMEC over the coming months. The staged approach which has been followed to develop the Blue X device through the WES program will be continued as it is firstly put through its paces at our smaller-scale, ‘gentler’ test site in Scapa Flow, prior to being subjected to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean at Billia Croo. “Getting metal wet and testing technologies for prolonged periods is vital to prove performance, reliability and survivability, as well as how to install, operate, maintain and decommission such structures. With more technologies tested here in Orkney than anywhere else in the world, we’ve built up a repertoire of knowledge which can be shared to aid Mocean Energy’s journey, and I’m very interested to see how the Blue X performs and what lessons it will learn.” The Blue X manufacture and testing program is being supported by £3.3 million from Wave Energy Scotland (WES) through their Novel Wave Energy Converter program. Earlier this year Mocean Energy announced a £1.6 million project with OGTC, oil major Chrysaor (now newly formed Harbour Energy) and subsea specialists EC-OG and Modus to demonstrate the potential of the Blue X prototype to power a subsea battery and a remote underwater vehicle – using onshore testing at EC-OG’s Aberdeen facility.

The project aims to capture and store up to 90% of the CO2 emissions from the involved industrial sites, playing an important role in contributing to the Paris Agreement goals, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Norwegian national emissions reduction targets. The Borg CO2 project includes several industry partners, as well as the Port of Borg, and aims to capture and store emissions from industrial facilities located in the cities of Fredrikstad, Sarpborg and Halden. The combined industrial cluster is currently responsible for approximately 700,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. After being captured, the CO2 will be liquified, shipped and eventually stored underneath the seabed of the North Sea. In April 2021, Borg CO2 announced an MOU with Northern Lights JV, who will provide shipping and storage of CO2 as a service provider for Borg CO2. Borg CO2 and its partners have completed a first feasibility study and are proceeding with an extended feasibility study (pre-FEED) to be completed by the end of 2021 which Baker Hughes will support with its portfolio of carbon capture technologies and engineering services for the study and development of the hub.

Baker Hughes said on Tuesday that the project would capture and store up to 90 per cent of the CO2 emissions from the involved industrial sites and contribute to the Paris Agreement goals, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and the Norwegian national emissions reduction targets. The Borg CO2 project includes several industry partners, as well as the Port of Borg, and aims to capture and store emissions from industrial facilities located in the cities of Fredrikstad, Sarpborg, and Halden. The combined industrial cluster is currently responsible for around 700,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. After being captured, the CO2 will be liquified, shipped, and eventually stored underneath the seabed of the North Sea. In April 2021, Borg CO2 and Northern Lights JV, the operator of the Northern Lights CCS project, signed a memorandum of understanding. The Northern Lights JV will provide shipping and storage of CO2 as a service provider for Borg CO2. Borg CO2 and its partners have completed a first feasibility study and are proceeding with an extended feasibility study (pre-FEED) to be completed by the end of 2021 which Baker Hughes will support with its portfolio of carbon capture technologies and engineering services for the study and development of the hub.

The Danish state-owned Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) has signed a shareholder’s agreement with the India-based ACME Group and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Under the agreement, IFU will acquire a 39% stake in a 250MW solar power plant in Rajasthan owned by ACME. UNOPS will invest in the project through its Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and Innovation (S3i) initiative. IFU invested in the project on behalf of the Danish SDG Investment Fund, which is backed by the Danish state, as well as large Danish pension funds and other private investors. IFU Investment Director Rahul Dubey said: “The investment is in line with our ambition to create green, just and inclusive societies because it will assist India in its green transition and provide additional energy supply to more people in India, allowing them to improve their livelihood.” The $178m (€150m) solar project, which is being developed by ACME Solar, will have the capacity to generate 675GWh of clean energy a year, enough to power 500,000 households. It will also have the capacity to offset 500,000t of carbon emissions. The project is expected to create 225 direct jobs during the construction phase and 75 permanent jobs during operation. Upon completion, the solar facility will add 250MW of solar power capacity to India’s national grid. The project also has a 25-year power purchase agreement in place with the Solar Energy Corporation of India. In another development, India has reportedly extended a $100m Line of Credit to Sri Lanka. This will help Sri Lanka finance solar energy projects and meet 70% of its power requirements with renewable energy sources by 2030. Some of the projects to be funded by the Line of Credit were announced during the International Solar Alliance’s (ISA) founding conference in March 2018.","The solar project, developed by ACME Solar, will have the capacity to generate 675GWh of clean energy a year.","['IFU', 'ACME Solar', 'ACME Group', 'Danish', 'International Solar Alliance', 'Investment Fund for Developing Countries', 'SDG', 'Solar Energy Corporation of India', 'UNOPS', 'United Nations Office for Project Services']","['Rahul Dubey']","['India', 'Sri Lanka', 'Rajasthan']"

Some 175 members of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) signed a pledge in early February against the use of forced labor in the supply chain. The industry organization said at the time that it first became aware of the labor issue late in 2020 and began communicating with its members companies that they needed to move their supply chains out of the Xinjiang region of China where the forced labor allegations were focused. In an interview at the time with pv magazine, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said that the trade group’s expectations were that companies would set up new factories and repurpose facilities in other parts of China, or rely on production from other nations. “The reality is that companies will start to lose business if they do not make these changes,” she said in the interview, adding that “we think that the shift will happen by the end of June.” Ross Hopper told pv magazine, “There is an urgency to this that companies understand” and that by the end of June, companies “will have had seven-plus months to make these changes.” Now, as June draws to a close, pv magazine followed up with SEIA to learn how well the domestic solar industry has met the goal Ross Hopper laid out in February. In response to an email, Jen Bristol, SEIA communications said, “We don’t know and we may not know” the percentage of the industry that has shifted its supply chain. Based on what SEIA has heard from the U.S. government and from customers, “most of the major suppliers have found sources of polysilicon outside of Xinjiang,” she said. In addition, SEIA has been in “close contact” with companies and has a “strong sense” that the largest suppliers are using SEIA’s newly issued supply chain protocol or adapting it to their own needs and are moving supply chains, she said. In May, in response to a question during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, the Biden administration’s climate envoy John Kerry confirmed that the administration is considering introducing additional sanctions on China that could affect the solar industry. In a story published June 21, the Politico news web site reported that the administration is considering an outright ban on polysilicon from the region. Mark D. Herlach, a partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm Eversheds Sutherland said in an interview that any sanctions could be calibrated and may well depend on the amount of political pressure directed toward the administration. In a note to clients, the firm said that possible sanctions could have implications on purchasers of panels. Implications could include direct legal jeopardy, financing challenges, supply chain disruptions, and reputational risk. The note said that reputational concerns, for example, have led major brands such as Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M, IKEA, Patagonia, and Tommy Hilfiger to stop buying cotton sourced from Xinjiang. Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee. The letter complained that the agency has been slow in following up on forced labor allegations and “has yet to take a single enforcement action.” It said that customs officials had received allegations in late 2020 and suggested “imminent enforcement action” three months ago. “We believe it is time to act,” the letter said. In late April, SEIA released the supply chain tracking tool that it said would increase transparency and help ensure that solar components are made ethically throughout the solar value chain. The Solar Supply Chain Traceability Protocol is a set of guidelines intended to help solar companies meet compliance obligations and “provide customers with assurances that their solar products are free of unethical labor practices.” “Solar customers expect their products to be ethically produced, and this protocol helps ensure that solar products coming into the United States are not made using forced labor,” said John Smirnow, SEIA’s vice president of market strategy on releasing the tool. The protocol is a set of recommended best practices that SEIA said is designed to prevent forced labor in the solar supply chain; help companies meet their U.S. import compliance obligations; and provide customers value chain transparency. SEIA said the tool was structured as an industry specification or de facto standard, with the expectation that it will be further developed into a formal industry standard. The protocol includes an audit mechanism intended to measure a company’s implementation and compliance. SEIA said that auditors would assess conformance. Companies with global supply chains typically have compliance officers whose job it is to ensure that a myriad of U.S. and international trade agreements, import restrictions, and related requirements are adhered to. A similar ramp-up in compliance monitoring could be in store for the solar industry. In her email to pv magazine, Bristol said that after the third-party audits are completed, “we’ll have a better sense of the level at which companies are successfully implementing the protocol.” Bristol expressed confidence that companies will be able to demonstrate to customs officials and customers that they are not using forced labor, “but those companies may not make all of their information public.” Also in her February interview, Ross Hopper told pv magazine that supply contracts may need to be renegotiated, but offered “I don’t think it’s going to have a huge impact on cost.” Four months later, Bristol said that, as with other sectors of the economy, “there are cost increases” associated with logistical challenges around the globe. With regard to logistical costs of moving poly production, “there is nothing unique about the shift of polysilicon capacity” from conflict regions within China. She said that extra production capacity is being added in other parts of China, India, Malaysia, Europe, and the United States. One source contacted by pv magazine said that supply chains can take years to establish, especially considering the capital needed to set up and establish alternative sources of basic supplies. In early June, First Solar said it would invest $680 million to expand its domestic U.S. photovoltaic solar manufacturing capacity by 3.3 GW annually. The facility would increase the company’s northwest Ohio footprint to a total annual capacity of 6 GWdc, which it said represents one of the largest fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing complexes outside of China. Higher commodity prices and delivery delays are beginning to affect portions of the U.S. solar industry, according to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie in their Solar Market Insight Report for the first quarter, published in mid-June. The report said the most significant impact of the current supply environment is on utility-scale projects that are under development. Developers are approaching off-takers to renegotiate their power purchase agreements (PPA) in an effort to increase prices or relax in-service dates. The report said that, so far, efforts to increase PPA prices on existing contracts “have not been very successful in a hyper-competitive market.” The report said the price of steel has more than doubled since the pandemic began. This has led to increased prices and lowered availability of solar racking equipment and trackers. Here, too, this has mostly affected utility-scale solar projects but has also impacted carport installations, which require more steel support structures than other solar projects. Equity research firm Roth Capital Advisors warned clients in a May 16 research note that current price pressures could delay as much as 15% of planned 2021 utility scale solar development.","The industry’s leading trade group has called for supply chains to shift by the end of June, and pressure grows on the Biden administration to act on allegations of forced labor use.","['SEIA', 'Biden', 'Eversheds Sutherland', 'First Solar', 'House Foreign Affairs Committee', 'House Ways and Means Committee', 'Patagonia', 'Politico', 'Roth Capital Advisors', 'Solar Energy Industries Association', 'Tommy Hilfiger', 'U S Customs and Border Protection', 'Wood Mackenzie']","['Abigail Ross Hopper', 'Jen Bristol', 'John Kerry', 'John Smirnow', 'Mark D.

One analyst warns of a “significant negative impact” across the U.S. solar industry. From pv magazine USA. The decision to ban products from four Chinese solar manufacturers based in the Xinjiang province taken today by the U.S. Biden Administration has already provoked reaction from both analysts and market players. John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), issued a statement that said, “The news of enforcement action on solar products coming from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is not unexpected and we fully support the Biden Administration’s efforts to address any forced labor in the solar supply chain. “SEIA will continue to work with the administration and our partners to stand against forced labor and build a clean energy future we can all be proud of.” Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that the move could have a “significant negative impact on the whole U.S. solar industry.” He said that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of MG-Si (magnesium silicide), a raw material needed for polysilicon production. Shen said that PV module imports may now need to prove that there is no content from Hoshine in order to enter the U.S. “Access to solar modules in the U.S., in our view, could be severely limited by this order as we believe isolating and tracing MG-Si through the supply chain could present a significant challenge.” Adding to pressure on the Biden administration, members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee. Reuters reported that Hoshine Silicon Industry said on an investor platform that it backed the Chinese foreign ministry’s reaction, adding that the firm does not export industrial silicon to the United States directly and that the impact on its business would be limited. Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co. sent the news agency an email saying the company has “zero tolerance” towards forced labor, and that it does not sell directly to U.S. companies, or buy from the United States, and there would not be “a significant impact on the company’s business.” Last September under the Trump administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued five Withhold Release Orders (WRO) on products from the Xinjiang region. Products included hair products, apparel, cotton, and some computer parts. Th Biden administration may have had no choice but to act on the ongoing allegations of forced labor in the solar supply chain, said Mark D.

One analyst warns of a “significant negative impact” across the U.S. solar industry. The Biden administration ordered a ban on U.S. imports from Chinese-based Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. over forced labor allegations, according to the Reuters news agency. The U.S. Commerce Department separately restricted exports to Hoshine, three other Chinese companies and what it said is the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), saying they were involved with the forced labor of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang. The news agency quoted China’s foreign ministry spokesman as saying China will take “all necessary measures” to protect its companies’ rights and interests. (Read “SEIA has a ‘strong sense’ that U.S. solar supply chains are shifting, but hard numbers are scarce.”). The three other companies added to the U.S. economic list include Xinjiang Daqo New Energy Co, a unit of Daqo New Energy Corp.; Xinjiang East Hope Nonferrous Metals Co, a unit of Shanghai-based manufacturer East Hope Group; and Xinjiang GCL New Energy Material Co., part of GCL New Energy Holdings Ltd. The Commerce Department said the companies and XPCC “have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in” Xinjiang. John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the Solar Energy Industries Association said, “The news of enforcement action on solar products coming from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) is not unexpected and we fully support the Biden administration’s efforts to address any forced labor in the solar supply chain.” He said the U.S. lacks transparency into supply chains in the Xinjiang region, and “there is too much risk in operating there.” Smirnow said that for that reason, last October SEIA began calling on solar companies to leave the region. In April, the trade group released a traceability protocol to help ensure there is not forced labor in the supply chain. “SEIA will continue to work with the administration and our partners to stand against forced labor and build a clean energy future we can all be proud of,” Smirnow said. At least some of the companies listed by the Commerce Department are manufacturers of monocrystalline silicon and polysilicon used in solar panel production. Philip Shen of Roth Capital Partners said in a note to clients that the move could have a “significant negative impact on the whole U.S. solar industry.” He said that Hoshine is an annual supplier of around 800,000 MT of MG-Si (magnesium silicide), a raw material needed for polysilicon production.

Johan Sverdrup is the biggest field development on the Norwegian continental shelf since the 1980s. The Johan Sverdrup Phase 2 development will capture the full potential of the huge Johan Sverdrup oil field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The new processing platform, which will be the second of its kind at the field centre, will make for a total of five platforms when the development is completed. The inshore mating of the P2 topside included integrating three modules weighing 13,500 metric tons, 5,400 metric tons, and 4,300 metric tons. This operation was the result of close cooperation between Heerema, client Aibel, and the operator of Johan Sverdrup – Equinor. According to Heerema, the modules were built in Thailand, Spain, and Norway and are Aibel’s largest project ever. Now that the lifting operations are complete, the topside has been towed by Heerema’s Kolga to Aibel’s yard in Haugesund. Then, on behalf of client Equinor, Sleipnir lifted the 12,050-metric ton P2 jacket, which is the heaviest jacket in the world so far to be lifted directly from the transportation barge. Heerema added that this installation method made it possible to reduce the jacket weight considerably, compared to a more traditional launch jacket, resulting in significant fabrication cost savings. Michel Hendriks, Heerema’s transport and installation director, said: “We are proud to play a part in Equinor’s Johan Sverdrup P2 development and to achieve two new lifting records in the process is always special. “Both projects were successful due to the close cooperation with our clients, and we look forward to returning to the Johan Sverdrup field later this year”.","Heerema’s Sleipnir, the LNG-powered world’s largest semi-submersible crane vessel, has set a record for the heaviest crane lift in Norwegian waters.","['Heerema', 'Sleipnir', 'Aibel', 'Equinor', 'Johan Sverdrup', 'Kolga']","['Heerema', 'Johan Sverdrup', 'Michel Hendriks']","['Gismarvik', 'Haugesund', 'Norway', 'Spain']"

The resolution will be put to shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting in Tokyo that starts at 0100 GMT on Friday. Activist investors are increasingly turning their attention to Japanese companies, using resolutions that have been employed in Europe and the United States to push companies and banks away from investing in, or financing, fossil fuels like coal, which still has strong support in Japan. The proposal “is essential for investors to correctly assess the transition risk and ambition level of the company, when it comes to addressing climate change,” Eric Christian Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Danish fund manager Nordea Asset Management, told Reuters by email. The 2015 Paris Agreement requires countries to curb emissions enough to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels to avert the worst effects of climate change. Sumitomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s board said in May it would oppose the shareholder resolution. Sumitomo is involved in two controversial coal power projects in Southeast Asia, the Van Phong 1 station in Vietnam and the Matarbari plant in Bangladesh, countries that have fast growing energy needs. Sumitomo recently announced it would aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. “We support the shareholder proposal,” Sachi Suzuki, senior engager at EOS at Federated Hermes, told Reuters by email. EOS at Federated Hermes has $1.5 trillion in assets under advice. KLP Asset Management, Norway’s largest pension fund, told Reuters by email it would also support the resolution, while Legal & General said on its website it would vote for it too.

Activist investors are increasingly turning their attention to Japanese companies, using resolutions that have been employed in Europe and the United States to push companies and banks away from investing in, or financing fossil fuels like coal, which still has strong support in Japan. The resolution put forward by the City of Kyoto, which owns a stake in Kansai and gave its name to the first international climate change agreement, requires Kansai Electric to stop building new coal plants and to use carbon capture and storage for its existing coal stations, a city official told Reuters earlier. Danish fund manager Nordea, which has around $300 billion under management, said it will back the proposal, which will be put to shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting in Osaka that starts at 0100 GMT. “A commitment by Kansai Electric Power Company not to build any new coal-fired power plants and to formulate and disclose a CO2 emissions reduction plan for their coal plants is not just the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do,” Eric Christian Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, said. Kansai Electric did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s board said earlier this month it opposes the shareholder resolution. Kansai Electric which serves Osaka and its industrial environs - an area with roughly the same economic output as Mexico - this week restarted an old reactor that had to get special approval to remain in operation. “There is no excuse for wasting capital on risky nuclear or polluting coal when clean solutions are readily available,” said Kiran Aziz, senior analyst and lawyer at KLP, Norway’s largest pension fund, which has $95 billion under management.

The European Commission (EC) has approved a €166.7m Greece support measure for the construction of a new LNG terminal in Alexandroupolis. The project is expected to enable the security and diversification of energy supplies in Greece and, particularly in the region of South East Europe. EC said that the support measure is in line with EU State aid rules, as it contributes to the security and diversification of energy supply, without affecting competition. EC executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager said: “The new LNG terminal in Alexandroupolis will improve gas supply and infrastructure not only in Greece, but in the whole South Eastern European region. “This will contribute to achievement of the EU’s goals in terms of security and diversification of energy supply. “The Greek support measure limits the aid to what is necessary to make the project happen and sufficient safeguards will be in place to ensure that potential competition distortions are minimised.” Greece will build a new LNG terminal in Alexandroupolis, including a Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) for the reception, storage and regasification of LNG. Also, the government will build a system of a sub-sea and an onshore gas transmission pipeline to connect the FSRU to the National Natural Gas System of Greece (NNGS). With an overall delivery capacity of 5.5 billion cubic meters per year, the FSRU of the new terminal will be located around 17.6km from the town of Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece, and 10km from the nearest shore. In addition to Greece, the terminal is expected to improve the security of supply for Bulgaria and for the wider South Eastern European region. The Greek authorities confirmed that the LNG terminal would be suitable for hydrogen, and enable a clean energy mix through increased use of gas instead of coal. Greece will finance the project with support from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), directly controlled and managed by the state. Gastrade will be the promoter and operator of the new terminal.","Greece will build a new LNG terminal in Alexandroupolis, including a Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU).","['EC', 'EU', 'European Commission', 'European Structural and Investment Funds', 'Gastrade']","['Margrethe Vestager']","['Greece', 'Alexandroupolis', 'Bulgaria', 'Europe']"

The Western Australia government has raised concerns about the federal environment department’s rejection of the latest plans for the Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) but the consortium behind the project has revealed it will work to amend those plans so the renewable energy project can go ahead. The federal government had initially backed plans for the AREH, proposed for development in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, granting the venture major project status last year. New environmental approvals were however needed after the consortium behind the project amended its plans, opting to use renewable energy to produce ammonia for export to Asia, rather than electricity. The consortium had referred plans to construct a 26 GW solar PV and wind farm near Port Hedland in WA’s north west. The facility would be used to power 14 GW of electrolysers to convert desalinated seawater into green hydrogen with most of the hydrogen converted to green ammonia for export. Federal environment minister Sussan Ley late last week refused to sign off on the new proposal, saying the expanded plans would have “clearly unacceptable” environmental impacts on threatened migratory species and internationally recognised wetlands. “The minister concluded that the proposal would have unacceptable impacts on matters of national environmental significance,” a ministerial spokesperson said. While the determination is a setback, the AREH consortium said it would continue to progress plans for the project and will address fully any concerns in preparing future project referrals. “The Asian Renewable Energy Hub consortium received notification from the minister for the environment late last week that an environmental referral for the project will not proceed in its current form,” the consortium said in a statement emailed to pv magazine. “We are now working to understand the minister’s concerns and will engage further with the minister and her department as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project.” While the consortium – including Intercontinental Energy, CWP Global, Vestas and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute – looks to refine its plans, the federal government’s decision has come under scrutiny in the state parliament this week with Western Australia hydrogen and regional development minister Alannah MacTiernan describing it as very concerning. “Our government is very concerned and perplexed by the premature rejection of the expanded Asian Renewable Energy Hub project proposal,” MacTiernan said on Tuesday. “The decision appears to have occurred with no meaningful engagement by the federal government with either the proponent or the state. “Typically, with complex projects, the federal government would work closely with the proponent and the relevant state government agencies to identify issues of concern and attempt to resolve potential environmental impacts before making a final ruling. “This does not appear to have occurred on this occasion and the project has been summarily rejected.” The AREH was granted major project status late last year and in December, the federal government conditionally approved the first stage under the commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The 15 GW first stage of the project had also secured state government environmental approvals. On receiving environmental approvals for stage 1, the project proponents made submissions for the expanded 26 GW second stage. Key revisions from the original project include the addition of processing plants, marine infrastructure including pipelines and an offshore export platform, and a new town to house workers. MacTiernan acknowledged the expanded second stage of the project had more complex environmental considerations that needed to be worked through but said the decision to reject it “at such an early stage is perplexing”. “The federal ruling was made just one month after the referral of the project was made,” she said. “The rapid rejection of this project sends the wrong messages about Australia as a leader in the emerging renewable hydrogen industry, and has potentially far-reaching implications for proponents considering investing in hydrogen in Australia.” MacTiernan called on the federal government to now work closely with the AREH consortium and the relevant state government agencies to identify issues of concern and attempt to resolve potential environmental impacts before making a final ruling. “This project has the potential to show just how we can transition away from fossil fuels towards green energy generation,” she said. “I urge the federal government to work constructively with the proponent to work through any issues of concern.” The decision to reject the expanded AREH plans follows resources minister Keith Pitt’s decision last month to veto a $280 million loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) to develop a wind and battery storage hub in northern Queensland.","Developers of one of the world’s largest renewable energy projects have vowed to push ahead with plans to build the $50 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub in Western Australia after the federal government’s decision to reject the project was labelled “perplexing” and “premature”.","['AREH', 'Asian Renewable Energy Hub', 'Australian National University', 'Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility', 'Vestas']","['Alannah MacTiernan', 'Keith Pitt', 'Sussan Ley']","['Australia', 'Asia', 'Pilbara', 'Port Hedland', 'WA']"

Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley has rejected the revised plan of the 26GW Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Western Australia on environmental grounds. The hybrid wind, solar, and green hydrogen and ammonia project proposed to be built in the Pilbara region with an investment of AUD50bn ($36bn) was granted ‘major project status’ in October 2020 by the Australian government. The project proponents are InterContinental Energy (ICE), CWP Global, Vestas, and Pathway Investments. Following the amendment in their plans for the project, the consortium needed to get new environmental approvals as they opted to renewably produce ammonia for export to Asia, instead of electricity. Originally, the plan was to transport renewable electricity to Asia through an undersea cable. In the revised plan, the consortium has proposed to focus on using up to 23GW of renewable electricity produced by the project for producing hydrogen and ammonia. The project also includes the construction of a desalination plant. As part of the new plans, Asian Renewable Energy Hub would need clearing land for installing wind and solar infrastructure, laying pipelines for ammonia transportation, and setting up a new town between Broome and Port Hedland to accommodate workers. Recently, Sussan Ley declined to sign on the consortium’s new proposal, reported ABC News. A ministerial spokesperson has been quoted by the publication, as saying: “The Minister concluded that the proposal would have unacceptable impacts on matters of national environmental significance.” As per the spokesperson, the project will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands near Eighty-mile Beach, which under the Ramsar agreement, are listed as an important site. Furthermore, the federal Environment Minister is said to have found that the project would put at risk endangered bird species living at the wetlands. The spokesperson has been further quoted by the publication, as saying: “The Minister found the marine component of the infrastructure corridor would disrupt tidal movement and processes, and this would seriously impact the habitats and life-cycle of the native species dependent on the wetland.” The Asian Renewable Energy Hub consortium said that it is working to understand the concerns of the minister and will further engage with her and her department. Meanwhile, the consortium said that it will be engaged in carving out the detailed design and engineering aspects of the renewable energy project. Clean Energy Council, a representative for the Australian clean energy industry, said that Environment Minister has turned down the expanded proposal for the project even before the completion of detailed environmental studies. The association stated: “The Clean Energy Council is seeking urgent clarification from the Federal Minister for the Environment to address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects.”","As per the federal Environmental Minister, the project will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands.","['Asian Renewable Energy Hub', 'Clean Energy Council', 'ABC News', 'InterContinental Energy', 'Pathway Investments', 'Sussan Ley', 'Vestas']","['Sussan Ley']","['Asia', 'Aus', 'Broome', 'Pilbara', 'Port Hedland']"

The murkiness of the Federal Government’s drive to make Australia an exporter of hydrogen, of any hue, gives rise to concerns. Australia’s and perhaps the world’s largest green energy and hydrogen project, the 26 GW, $50 billion Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) slated for the Pilbara region of Western Australia was last year granted Major Project Status by the Commonwealth Government; last week it was stamped by the same government as “clearly unacceptable” on the grounds that it impacts wetlands near Eighty-mile Beach, which are designated of international significance under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley rejected the latest plans proposed for AREH — which shifted required infrastructure to suit production and export of green hydrogen and ammonia, rather than the original plan which mooted export of most of the project’s prodigious electricity output via underwater cable to Asia — on the grounds that they would pose a risk to threatened bird species that inhabit the wetlands. The Minister found that “the marine component of the infrastructure corridor would disrupt tidal movement and processes, and this would seriously impact the habitats and life-cycle of the native species dependent on the wetland,” a ministerial spokesperson said. AREH consortium members include Intercontinental Energy (one of the world’s biggest green hydrogen developers); renewable energy developer CWP Global; Vestas wind-turbine system manufacturers; the Nyangumarta traditional owners; and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute. In response to last week’s rejection, the group issued a statement saying, “We will take concerns on board as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project.” In October 2020 AREH was deemed to dovetail with the Federal Government’s Technology Investment Road map, which highlights hydrogen (renewable or fossil-fuel derived) development as an investment priority. The Government’s decision comes at a time when its coalition is under pressure from leadership ructions in the National Party, which coalesced late last week into virulent rejection of a pending Federal Government commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. This morning those ructions turned into a spill that reinstates anti-net zero emissions populist, Barnaby Joyce as head of the Nationals, and as Deputy Prime Minister. Sussan Ley’s decision predates today’s demonstration of Nationals’ discontent, but seems to have caught other supporters of the AREH project unawares. Allanah MacTiernan, the Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and the Hydrogen Industry, said “We’re very surprised at how quickly the decision was met, and it appears that there wasn’t a lot of discussion with the proponent.” She also suggested that coal-based hydrogen projects, which often have significant environmental impacts related to emissions, have easily negotiated Federal Government approval. Development of the AREH proposal began in 2014, and Lead Agency Status was granted by the WA Government in 2018, followed by the Federal Major Project Status conferral last year. “Major Status” assumes fast-tracking — though not sidelining of environmental and other responsibilities — of the project in anticipation of the benefits it will bring to a region, or to the country as a whole. A land parcel of 6,500 square kilometres has been secured for the combined wind and solar generation of the AREH through the WA Department of Lands, and the project was identified as a major diversifier of the Pilbara economy, generating some 20,000 jobs during its 10 years of staged construction, and thousands of permanent jobs as operations come on line from 2027. Some 3 GW of output from the vast project are earmarked for large energy users in the Pilbara region which may include new or expanded mines and downstream processing of minerals, enabling a value-added component to Australia’s export of resources. The Western Australian Government approved the first, 15 GW stage of the AREH, in 2018, based on the recommendation of the state’s Environmental Protection Authority. Back in 2017, the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment had also conditionally approved AREH’s then proposal. The conditions related to several impacts, on terrestrial, marine and wetland habitat, but with regard to wetlands in particular, they included: “To avoid and mitigate the impacts of infrastructure on threatened shorebirds and migratory birds the approval holder must: space wind turbines such that individual turbines in each row are separated by at least 800m and each row is separated at least four kilometres from the next row” and that the proponent should “not undertake construction or cable installation activities within the Eighty Mile Beach Ramsar Site boundary during peak migration periods for threatened shorebirds and migratory birds (1 October through to 31 March in any year)”. AREH plans, more recently amended towards large-scale export of green ammonia, are understood to include development of pipelines to transport ammonia and the construction of a new town between Broome and Port Hedland to house workers. With limited detail available, it is hard to fully understand how the project now warrants a decision that declares it “unacceptable” and therefore unapproved. The Clean Energy Council (CEC) released a statement this morning saying it understands, “that the Federal Minister for the Environment has rejected the expanded proposal for this project prior to the completion of detailed environmental studies”. The renewable energy industry body is now “seeking urgent clarification” and for Sussan Ley to “address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects”. In a report by ABC News this morning, MacTiernan said “We need to be very clear about where the government stands with hydrogen.” She, too, alluded to the approvals of “quite controversial coal projects” in the push to develop hydrogen of any hue. She added, “Everyone, theoretically, has signed on to the notion that we will be ultimately replacing our natural gas exports with hydrogen exports. We’re going to need to work cooperatively to find a way in which this can be done.” Asked by the ABC to comment on the rejection of AREH’s proposal this morning Professor Andrew Blakers from the ANU’s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions emphasised the importance of locating and building renewable energy projects to high environmental standards, but added, that he would like to see “all mine sites in the future” run “primarily from solar and/or wind”. In the light of AREH’s potential to enable such ambitions for Australian minerals extraction, he hoped the project would be able to work around the issues raised by the Federal Government approval process. He said “Firm adherence to guidelines means most of the potential environmental downsides will already have been thought out and ameliorated.” In its statement, the CEC says it expects the Commonwealth to work in partnership with the AREH consortium, and “provide the necessary guidance to appropriately assess and address any environmental impact” of the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It describes the AREH as “a transformative economic opportunity for Australia, making a significant contribution to local and global decarbonisation efforts.” Has decarbonisation been taken off the National agenda as the Government heads towards an election with the emissions-breathing Nationals in tow?","Is there something fishy about Environment Minister Sussan Ley rejecting the Asian Renewable Energy Hub’s development application?

Italian energy giant Enel and Russian technology company Rusnano want to set up Russia’s first green-hydrogen production project at a wind farm in the Murmansk region. Israel-based manufacturer of fuel cell energy solutions, GenCell Energy, has completed an advanced testing period of its experimental GenCell A5 off-grid hydrogen power solution, based on alkaline fuel cell (AFC) technology, at the site of an active emergency communications system (ECS) station outside Reykjavik, Iceland, operated by state-owned Icelandic telecom provider Neyðarlínan. “GenCell and Neyðarlínan ohf have agreed to carry out a second testing period in the extreme weather conditions typical of the Arctic regions in the winter months, between December 2021 and February 2022. Following the satisfactory completion of the winter evaluation, the two companies will negotiate the deployment of GenCell A5 units at 112 active emergency communication sites across Iceland,” reads the note released on Monday. Representatives of Italian utility Enel and Russian innovation development agency Rusnano have discussed collaboration opportunities to create Russia’s first green hydrogen production project at a wind farm in the Murmansk region. “The joint project with Rusnano will be our first step in starting to explore this promising area in various parts of Russia,” said Simone Mori, the head of Enel’s Europe division. The two companies had signed a memorandum of understanding to look into the option to produce hydrogen at Enel Russia’s Kola Wind Power Plant (capacity: 201 MW), which is being constructed in the Murmansk region. According to Rusnano, it will be the largest wind farm in the Russian Arctic, and will be able to generate 750 GWh of electricity per year. “Russia has a huge potential, both as a producer and as a consumer of green hydrogen … The successful implementation of this joint project with Enel will prove that there is a real demand for the production of green hydrogen, and enable us to scale up the project in the future, thus contributing to the development of Russia’s national hydrogen strategy,” said Sergey Kulikov, chairman of the executive board of Rusnano. The meeting happened during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum earlier this month. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) presented, last week, the country's “green growth strategy,” aiming to accelerate the energy transition and achieve carbon neutrality in 2050. “Pursue hydrogen as an option to the maximum possible extent. Increase supply and demand, improve infrastructure, and reduce costs. Create a hydrogen industry and fuel ammonia industry,” reads the strategy to 2050 published by Japan’s trade and industry ministry. Japan wants to become the leader in the growing ‘green-steel' market. METI plans to subsidize technology innovation in steelmaking processes using part of a ¥2 trillion (€15.2 billion) government fund meant to support green innovation in the next 10 years. The Japanese government and national companies are looking into carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, indicating that the country could give priority to blue hydrogen. On Tuesday, for instance, Tokyo-based general trading company Itochu said it is joining the Geological Carbon Dioxide Storage Technology Research Association, to participate in a project to research and develop technologies for the underground sequestration of carbon dioxide. On Tuesday, Hiroshi Kajiyama, Japan’s minister of economy, attended the first Asia CCUS Network Forum and announced the launch of the “Asia CCUS Network.” The Colombian Congress has approved the Energy Transition Law. The law, which now only requires the president’s signature, recognizes green and blue hydrogen as non-conventional sources of renewable energy. This means that the technologies behind these two types of hydrogen will be eligible for the tax benefits of Law 1715: Income deduction, VAT exclusion, zero tariffs, and accelerated depreciation. Regarding sustainable mobility, the text of the law suggests that the national government will adopt programs to promote the use of hydrogen and gas fuel in land transportation, for both goods and passengers. California-based developer NewHydrogen signed an agreement to further expand the existing sponsored research agreement with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) to develop technology to reduce the cost of green hydrogen production. “With an increased budget, the new agreement expands the scope of the non-precious-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst development program,” reads the note released on Tuesday. The UCLA researchers came up with a non-precious-metal-based catalyst that “demonstrated significant improvement of OER in acidic conditions by substituting part of the existing metal element in the aforementioned catalyst material structure.” NewHydrogen sees, in the catalyst’s low cost and high durability, two good reasons to use the non-precious-metal instead of platinum. Australia’s federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, has rejected the latest plans proposed for the 26 GW, AU$50-billion (€31.6 billion) Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in Western Australia. The project, possibly the largest green energy and hydrogen endeavor in the world, was granted major project status by the Commonwealth government last year. The reversal of fortune is due to the AREH’s alleged impacts on wetlands near Eighty Mile Beach, which are designated as having international significance under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. AREH consortium members include green hydrogen developers Intercontinental Energy, renewable energy developer CWP Global, wind-turbine system manufacturer Vestas, indigenous people the Nyangumarta, and the Australian National University’s Energy Change Institute. “We will take concerns on board as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project,” the group said. According to the original timeline, green hydrogen exports should start in 2027/2028. Nel Hydrogen Electrolyser, a division of Norway-based hydrogen company Nel ASA, has entered into a collaboration for a fossil-free hydrogen facility in Hofors, Sweden, together with partners Ovako, Volvo, Hitachi ABB, and H2 Green Steel. “We are very excited to enter into this shared initiative to jointly develop fossil-free alternatives for the steel industry. Green hydrogen has the characteristics to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from steel rolling and milling, and this will be the first project in the world to heat steel with hydrogen prior to rolling,” Jon André Løkke, Nel’s CEO, commented in a note released on Tuesday. According to Nel, the conversion to hydrogen will enable reduction of CO2 emissions for steel production in Hofors by 50%, with additional positive externalities. “The plant can be used flexibly and can therefore support the stability of the electrical grid, which in turn will permit more use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, it will be a step in the direction of developing a hydrogen infrastructure for the transportation sector, with locally produced fossil-free hydrogen for fuel cell vehicle trucks.”","Israel-based GenCell has unveiled an off-grid hydrogen power solution based on alkaline fuel cell (AFC) technology.

The Australian federal government has rejected plans for the Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In a decision dated 15 June on the government’s website, environment minister Sussan Ley determined that the $36bn project will have “clearly unacceptable impacts” on internationally recognised wetlands and migratory bird species. The ruling means that the consortium behind the AREH development, which includes green hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy, renewables company CWP Energy Asia, wind turbine manufacturer Vestas and a Macquarie Group fund, will now have to alter its plans to keep the project alive. “We are now working to understand the minister’s concerns, and will engage further with the minister and her department as we continue to work on the detailed design and engineering aspects of the project,” said the AREH consortium. The project, which has been in the planning stages since 2014, originally set out to generate wind and solar power that would be transmitted via an undersea cable to Asia – but the plans were altered by the consortium last year. It decided a 26-gigawatt (GW) hybrid solar-wind farm would instead be used to power 14GW of electrolysers that convert desalinated seawater into green hydrogen – most of which would then be converted to green ammonia for export. Dubbed the world’s largest renewable energy project, the consortium claims it would enable the creation of new supply chain facilities for the manufacturing and assembly of equipment for wind and solar generation and for hydrogen production. About 20,000 jobs would be created during the 10-year project construction period, with 3,000 jobs created for the 50+ year operational period. Last year, AREH was granted major project status by the federal government and the first stage of the development was given the go-ahead by the Western Australian government. But, following an updated proposal submitted to the federal environment department last month, Ley decided to reject the project. A spokesperson for the environment minister said the development would affect the ecological character of a Ramsar-listed 80-mile beach site and several migratory species, including seven threatened species and an internationally significant waterbird population. “The minister found the marine component of the infrastructure corridor would disrupt tidal movements and processes and this would seriously impact the habitats and life-cycle of the native species dependent upon the wetland and, accordingly, the ecological character of the 80-mile Beach Ramsar site itself,” they added. Responding to the news, the Australian Clean Energy Council said it understands the environment minister rejected the expanded proposal “prior to the completion of detailed environmental studies”. “The Clean Energy Council is seeking urgent clarification from the federal minister for the environment to address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects,” it added. “We expect that the Commonwealth will work in partnership with the Asian Renewable Energy Hub to provide the necessary guidance to appropriately assess and address any environmental impacts under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.”","Environment minister Sussan Ley determined that the $36bn project will have “clearly unacceptable impacts"" on internationally recognised wetlands and migratory bird species.","['Australian Clean Energy Council', 'AREH', 'Asian Renewable Energy Hub', 'CWP Energy Asia', 'Commonwealth', 'InterContinental Energy', 'Macquarie Group', 'Vestas']","['Sussan Ley']","['Australia', 'Asia', 'Beach Ramsar', 'Pilbara']"

The Western Australian government approved the first 15 GW stage of the AREH, in 2018, based on the recommendation of the state’s Environmental Protection Authority. Back in 2017, the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment had also conditionally approved AREH’s then proposal. The conditions related to several impacts, on terrestrial, marine and wetland habitat, but with regard to wetlands in particular, included: “To avoid and mitigate the impacts of infrastructure on threatened shorebirds and migratory birds the approval holder must: space wind turbines such that individual turbines in each row are separated by at least 800m and each row is separated at least four kilometres from the next row” and that the proponent should “not undertake construction or cable installation activities within the Eighty Mile Beach Ramsar Site boundary during peak migration periods for threatened shorebirds and migratory birds (1 October through to 31 March in any year)”. AREH plans, more recently amended towards large-scale export of green ammonia, are understood to include development of pipelines to transport ammonia and the construction of a new town between Broome and Port Hedland to house workers. With limited detail available, it is hard to fully understand how the project now warrants a decision that declares it “unacceptable” and therefore unapproved. The Clean Energy Council (CEC) released a statement this morning saying it understands, “that the Federal Minister for the Environment has rejected the expanded proposal for this project prior to the completion of detailed environmental studies”. The renewable energy industry body is now “seeking urgent clarification” and for Ley to “address the perception that this decision is inconsistent with well-established processes or with the treatment of non-renewable projects”. In a report by ABC News this morning, MacTiernan said, “We need to be very clear about where the government stands with hydrogen.” She, too, alluded to the approvals of “quite controversial coal projects” in the push to develop hydrogen of any hue. She added, “Everyone, theoretically, has signed on to the notion that we will be ultimately replacing our natural gas exports with hydrogen exports. We’re going to need to work cooperatively to find a way in which this can be done.” Asked by the ABC to comment on the rejection of AREH’s proposal this morning Professor Andrew Blakers from the ANU’s Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions emphasised the importance of locating and building renewable energy projects to high environmental standards, but added that he would like to see “all mine sites in the future” run “primarily from solar and/or wind”. In the light of AREH’s potential to enable such ambitions for Australian minerals extraction, he hoped the project would be able to work around the issues raised by the federal government approval process. “Firm adherence to guidelines means most of the potential environmental downsides will already have been thought out and ameliorated,” he said. In its statement, the CEC says it expects the Commonwealth to work in partnership with the AREH consortium and “provide the necessary guidance to appropriately assess and address any environmental impact” of the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. It describes the AREH as “a transformative economic opportunity for Australia, making a significant contribution to local and global decarbonisation efforts.” Has decarbonisation been taken off the National agenda as the government heads towards an election with the emissions-breathing Nationals in tow?","The murkiness of the federal government’s drive to make Australia an exporter of hydrogen, of any hue, gives rise to concerns.","['AREH', 'ABC News', 'Commonwealth', 'Nationals’', 'Western Australian Department of Lands', 'ANU', 'Australian Department of Agriculture Water and the Environment', 'Australian National University', 'CEC', 'Clean Energy Council', 'Institute', 'Intercontinental Energy', 'National Party', 'Nyangumarta', 'Vestas']","['Sussan Ley', 'Allanah MacTiernan', 'Andrew Blakers', 'Barnaby Joyce']","['Australia', 'Pilbara', 'Asia', 'Beach', 'Broome', 'Eighty', 'Port Hedland']"

ABU DHABI - The Mohamed Bin Zayed Solar PV Complex, one of the largest solar PV plant in West Africa financed by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) and selected under the ADFD-IRENA Project Facility, is now fully operational. The 50-megawatt (MW) project in Blitta, Togo, will supply reliable, clean electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the country to receive a sustainable supply of clean energy. The new Blitta solar PV plant was inaugurated yesterday at a celebration marking the official opening of the facility located on a 92-hectare site in the Centrales region of Togo. The inauguration was attended by Togo President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé Eyadéma; Khalifa Abdullah Al Qubaisi, ADFD Deputy Director-General; Hussain Jassim Al Nowais, Chairman of Board of Directors of AMEA Power Company; Ahmed Badr, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Acting-Director of Project Facilitation, and senior officials from the Togolese government. The new plant can produce 50 megawatts of clean energy and will power more than 158,000 homes and small businesses, significantly reducing dependence on firewood and charcoal for energy consumption. It will help advance the Togolese national clean energy strategy and its aspiration to increase its renewable energy share by 50 percent by 2025 and 100 percent by 2030 while reducing CO2 emissions in the country by more than one million tons. The project created 700 jobs during construction, out of which 80 percent were Togolese. ADFD, the economic development arm of the UAE Government, provided US$15million (AED55million) to finance the project in the form of a concessionary loan. The Mohamed Bin Zayed Solar Complex was developed by Amea Togo Solar, a subsidiary of Amea Power, a global renewable energy developer based in the UAE. The Togo solar power plant is part of ADFD’s partnership with IRENA to advance the development of clean energy alternatives while stimulating sustainable economic growth in developing countries around the world. ADFD has committed $350 million (AED1.28 billion) for concessionary loans dedicated to clean energy development projects. Together ADFD and IRENA have supported the development of 32 clean energy projects in 26 countries, generating a capacity of 245 megawatts to fuel the power generation needs of more than 4.5 million households and businesses. Al Suwaidi said, ""We are proud to have this state-of-the-art facility carry the name Mohamed Bin Zayed Solar Complex. This solar park truly reflects the level of sustainable impact we can achieve through the ADFD and IRENA renewable energy development programme. This new solar plant will greatly advance the Togolese commitment to combat climate change through a shift to clean energy while creating new jobs, supporting the local business community and expanding community access to social services."" ""Renewables are at the heart of our national energy goals and are a vital component of our broader social development and economic growth ambitions,"" said Mila Aziablé, Minister Delegate to the President of the Togolese Republic, in charge of Energy and Mines. ""This is a very significant moment in our country. It marks a positive step on our journey towards building an energy system that is inclusive and clean, and that creates jobs and improves access to energy. Renewables can shape an entirely new and positive era in the development of Togo, and we are extremely grateful to all the partners involved in delivering this project."" Al Nowais, in turn, commented, ""The UAE’s private sector is keeping pace with the government direction to increase adoption of renewable energy globally and advancing the UAE’s pioneering role in the development of sustainable clean energy solutions around the world."" ""This is a highly significant project not just for Togo but for the whole of West Africa,"" said Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA. ""It’s scale and speed of development shows what can be achieved in the region when the right blend of partners come together with purpose and intent. Africa holds tremendous promise for renewable power generation, which can bring improved energy access and reliability of supply while creating jobs and economic opportunity."" This is Togo’s first solar plant and a key element of the country’s bid to achieve energy independence by 2030 while delivering on its pledge to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). With a population of some 8.2 million people, Togo has traditionally relied on biomass as the dominant source of energy, which is a major contributor to fossil fuel pollution. National production capacity was insufficient to cover demand, leaving Togo reliant on expensive energy imports from countries including Ghana and Nigeria. With the new solar plant now feeding power to the grid, Togo expects to significantly cut fossil energy consumption as well as energy imports. Expanding and diversifying the country’s energy resources is also expected to boost the connection rate of local households while enabling neighbouring communities to improve access to services such as public sanitation, education, and healthcare. The project is just one example of ADFD and IRENA’s support for the development of Africa’s renewable energy sector. In 2020, ADFD signed loan agreements worth $33million (AED121 million) with the governments of Togo, Niger and Liberia on the sidelines of the IRENA Assembly held in Abu Dhabi. ADFD/IRENA projects span Asia, Africa, Latin America and Small Island Developing States, encompassing the complete spectrum of renewable energy sources – wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and biomass – and technologies.","The new plant can produce 50 megawatts of clean energy and will power more than 158,000 homes and small businesses.","['ADFD-IRENA', 'ADFD IRENA', 'AMEA Power Company', 'Abu Dhabi Fund for Development', 'Amea Power', 'Amea Togo Solar', 'International Renewable Energy Agency', 'UAE Government', 'United Nations Framework']","['Hussain Jassim Al Nowais', 'Ahmed Badr', 'Al Suwaidi', 'Francesco La Camera', 'Khalifa Abdullah Al Qubaisi', 'Mila Aziablé']","['Togo', 'Africa', 'UAE', 'Niger', 'ABU DHABI', 'Abu Dhabi', 'Blitta', 'Ghana', 'Latin America', 'Liberia']"

IRENA and the ADFD provided $15 million in loan funding for the project to be developed by AMEA Togo Solar. IRENA provided technical assistance and solutions for the project to be constructed ahead of schedule despite disruptions caused by COVID-19. Some 700 jobs were created and an additional 120 direct and indirect jobs during operation. The project will play a key role in helping Togo to advance its clean energy strategy which is designed to increase the share of renewable energy within the energy mix to 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2030. Some 160,000 households and small businesses will be powered by the new plant, reducing the country’s dependence on firewood, charcoal, and fuel imports for energy consumption. Togo has not been able to meet its energy demand due to limited energy generation infrastructure and as such has relied on biomass and energy imports from Ghana and Nigeria to power its population.

"https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/06/18/solar-101-it-all-comes-down-to-curb-appeal/","https://pv-magazine-usa.com/","Solar 101: It all comes down to curb appeal","2021-06-18 14:53:49","The residential solar industry has taken notice of the demand for beautiful, hidden panels, and is now providing creative and attractive designs that you can incorporate into your rooftop solar project. When it comes to buying residential solar panels in the United States, the most important factor is curb appeal. U.S. home equity collectively represents the largest savings account in the country. And because aesthetics are among the most important factors in determining the value of a home, America’s residential solar consumers tend to get a bit, well, persnickety. So what is it, exactly, that makes a solar panel attractive? At pv magazine USA we believe that all solar panels are beautiful. But we are aware that grumpy neighbors and local HOAs have opinions, too. The residential solar industry has taken notice of the demand for beautiful, hidden panels, and is now exploring techniques to provide creative and attractive designs. Tesla answered the call by designing a new roofing product – Solar Glass – to hold the solar cells. This product is drop-dead gorgeous, though, sadly, it seems to have been made from unobtanium. So far, Tesla has been struggling to deliver these roofs on time, and growing pains have resulted in startling price increases. Other manufacturers are experimenting with the “solar shingle” form factor, including Luma Solar and Certainteed. These groups are seeking to replace the standard asphalt shingle with a shingle that contains a solar panel. GAF Energy is installing a standard solar panel, but adding refinements to smooth the hard edges, and replacing the shingles, but not other roofing material layers. In mid-June, the company said it had finished work on its largest-ever residential solar roofing system, a 31 kW system in California that is expected to produce 50,455 kWh of energy annually. In Europe, Viridian Solar panels attach flush to the roof, completely replacing roofing material. Sadly, these clever panels are not yet available in the U.S. And for now, nearly all of these designer panels are still niche products. Standard solar panels with finer aesthetic qualities – thinner, black frames and black backsheets – remain the most common product available. Installations like Solaria’s, above, represent some of the cleanest lines to be found. The company’s shingled solar cells make it so you only see the black surface of silicon and aluminum framing. One leading solar panel for residential customers is manufactured in Georgia at the Hanwha Q Cell factory. They’re available, reasonably priced (no import tariffs), and they offer adequate specs and aesthetics. The Solar Marketplace Intel Report from EnergySage provides a list of potential pieces of hardware to buy. Note that EnergySage’s data does not represent 100% of the residential solar market, although it does offer a solid cross section of higher quality components. Beyond looks, the reasons to choose one panel over another vary greatly. Efficiency, price, panel size, availability, country of origin, and even the environmental impacts of a panel’s manufacturing process all factor in. Because the price of solar power systems has fallen, with solar panel prices decreasing even more so, pricing has stopped being the most important factor in a solar purchasing decision. The most important factors today are a combination of efficiency and product quality. In the most recent Tracking the Sun report from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, we see a few the trends emerge as prices drop and efficiencies rise: However, there is still a premium paid for more efficient solar panels. Sunpower’s Maxeon has always been the most efficient, and typically the most expensive. Others, like the REC Alpha, LG’s Neon series, Solaria, and soon Meyer Burger’s heterojunction product, are moving into the same higher tier of efficiency greater than 22%. After this tradeoff of looks vs. efficiency vs. price vs. availability, we turn toward less tangible factors such as location of manufacture, the specific technologies used, and even how much CO2 was emitted during the manufacturing process. These factors lead to the broad variety of panels we see in the market today. Because there are hundreds of different solar panels in the market, it is tough to cover all of them. For instance, solar panels can be bought from many countries in the world, including the U.S. Some companies exclusively manufacture solar panels, while others – like LG or Panasonic – are part of international conglomerates. You could even buy a solar panel with polysilicon made via mostly hydropower. Since 2014, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research has shown the viability of painting the surface of a solar panel painted with nano-materials in the factory. And the company Sistine Solar sells its “solar skin”, a custom graphic overlay that preserves 92%-99% of a solar panel’s efficiency while matching the aesthetic of any building. One final consideration is how much space you have available. Those with limited roof space may want to take a close look at panel dimensions in order to maximize energy production. Residential panels tend to be roughly 65” long by 39” wide, but sizes are not written in stone (or polysilicon). For example, Sunpower has manufactured 425W panels that measure 72.2” by 40”. And Solaria’s PowerXT 400W panel is extra wide, at 64.72” by 47.4”. If you’re sketching various configurations, add about 1” between panels for mid-clamps. Also remember that most states require panels to be set back 36” or more from the roof’s ridge. Some states like Massachusetts and Florida do not have any setback restrictions, which allows installation right up to the edge of your roof. Your local building inspectors and contractors should know exactly how much setback is required. With all of these variables, you can get overwhelmed with choices; it’s kind of like buying a car. One of the better pieces of advice might be to find a contractor you like and trust, and have her or him recommend products for your home. Lessons you’ve gleaned from this article will help you vet those panels.","The residential solar industry has taken notice of the demand for beautiful, hidden panels, and is now providing creative and attractive designs that you can incorporate into your rooftop solar project.","['EnergySage', 'LG', 'Solaria', 'Tesla', 'Certainteed', 'GAF Energy', 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'Luma Solar', 'Maxeon', 'Meyer Burger', 'Organization for Applied Scientific Research', 'Panasonic', 'Sistine Solar', 'Sunpower', 'Viridian Solar']","[]","['U S', 'America', 'California', 'Europe', 'Florida', 'Georgia', 'Massachusetts', 'Netherlands', 'USA', 'United States']"

Petróleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, is reviewing its contracts with Vitol in search of better terms after the company admitted to paying bribes in Mexico to win business. The Dutch firm has offered Pemex $30 million as compensation for damages. “Hopefully they will stop trying to solve the problem without saying who the official was who asked them for money,” López Obrador said in his morning press conference. “We want the name of the person who supposedly received the money,” he said. At the end of last year, Vitol agreed to pay $164 million to U.S. and Brazilian authorities after admitting it bribed officials in Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador between 2015 and 2020 to obtain and retain business with state oil companies in those countries. A Pemex source said the company has insisted from the beginning on knowing the name of the officials involved in the bribery in order to take corrective measures, but could not specify whether this issue is key to reaching an agreement with Vitol on the compensation of damage. A Vitol representative could not immediately be reached for comment. In March, Pemex CEO Octavio Romero told Reuters that in its review of the Vitol contracts the company will look for irregularities and try to eliminate conditions it considers unfavorable. He added that if an agreement is not reached, work with the energy marketer will stop.

In April, the Connecticut investment firm proposed the construction of 11 natural-gas fired power plants, aiming to improve grid reliability during times of extreme demand. State grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), on Monday asked residents to reduce electricity use “as much as possible” through Friday, citing plants supplying 11,000 megawatts that were offline as temperatures hit 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius). Starwood’s proposal to build “peaker plants” for such outages was the second presented to Texas this year. A similar plan for 10 plants was submitted in March by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “We would like to see significant steps in countering, negotiating and material tangible actions on our proposal,” said Himanshu Saxena, chief executive of Starwood Energy, in an interview on Monday. The company has held early conversations with stakeholders, Saxena said, and lawmakers have looked at proposals submitted to ERCOT and state regulator the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), according to a spokesperson for the PUCT. “We would love to see more urgency from the system,” Saxena said. “I think there is interest, in the sense that folks are curious about what we’re offering to do.” A February winter storm that caught generators off guard knocked out power for millions across Texas, leaving more than 150 people dead and driving up electricity prices to levels that put several suppliers in bankruptcy court. Then, as now, there were a number of plants offline for repairs. Starwood’s proposal requires legislative action, Saxena said, noting the long lead times for large-scale projects. Both proposals were presented to the Texas legislature during a session that ended on May 31, according to the PUCT spokesperson. Texas lawmakers in May approved bills to overhaul the power grid, including requiring some plants to weatherize systems.","(Reuters) - A proposal to spend $8 billion on new power plants in Texas has stalled, Starwood Energy Group’s chief executive said on Monday, as the state’s grid operator called for conservation amid record demand.","['Starwood Energy Group', 'PUCT', 'Berkshire Hathaway Inc', 'ERCOT', 'Electric Reliability Council of Texas', 'Public Utility Commission of Texas']","['Himanshu Saxena']","['Texas', 'Connecticut']"

Equinor and its partners have already received consent from the Petroleum Safety Authority for life extensions for the Heimdal platform with associated pipelines and wells. Since its start-up in 1985, Heimdal has produced 46 billion standard cubic metres of gas and 7 million cubic metres of liquid (oil/condensate), corresponding to 332 million barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, Heimdal has processed approximately the same volume of oil and gas from the satellite fields Huldra, Skirne, Atla, Vale, and Valemon. Production from Valemon is expected to increase in the future as 3-4 new gas wells will be drilled for Valemon in 2021 and 2022. This enables Heimdal to maintain profitable operations somewhat longer than originally communicated (2021 or 2022). As explained by Equinor, the extension will enable the production of the remaining reserves in Vale and Skirne and increase production from Valemon. “Heimdal is an important field that has repeatedly led the way for the Norwegian petroleum industry. First by contributing to the construction of Statpipe, which is a cornerstone for Norwegian gas export to Europe. Then by capturing value also after its own resources were produced. Heimdal illustrates how investments in infrastructure offshore drive future value creation opportunities”, said Geir Sørtveit, Equinor’s senior vice president of Exploration and Production West. Sørtveit added: “When Heimdal is shut down the field will have produced and processed about 700 million barrels of oil equivalent and generated revenues estimated at about NOK 260 billion for the partners processing at Heimdal and for Norway”. Located in the northeastern part of the North Sea, Heimdal was found in 1972, when an exploration well proved a 120-metre gas column in Palaeocene sand. Although considerable gas resources were struck, it was long uncertain whether the field could be developed. No transportation system for gas export from the Norwegian continental shelf had been established, which was an important challenge. But the solution was found in 1981. With gas from both Heimdal and Gullfaks, in addition to gas from Statfjord, there was a sufficient resource basis for the construction of Statpipe – the new European Highway for gas from Norway to the continent, and in addition the construction of the onshore plant at Kårstø. The field development concept included an integrated processing, drilling, and accommodation platform with a steel jacket. An export pipeline for condensate was laid to the Brae field on the UK continental shelf. In 1985, the Kårstø plant delivered the first gas to the continent. Statpipe and the Kårstø plant have later become key to the Norwegian gas machine. In 2020, Kårstø exported energy in the form of gas and oil products corresponding to about 400TWh/year. By way of comparison, all Norwegian waterpower production accounts for about 137 TWh/year. At the end of the 1990s most of the gas in the Heimdal reservoir had been produced, and it was uncertain how long the operations could continue. However, Equinor (then Norsk Hydro), who had had a small interest in Heimdal from the start, saw new opportunities and took over the operatorship after ELF (TotalEnergies). Under Equinor’s management, Heimdal was in 2001 reconstructed to a gas processing hub. This involved tie-in of the Huldra, Skirne and Vale gas fields for processing, in addition to the use of Heimdal as a transit point for gas export from Oseberg to the UK. In order to accomplish this, a new riser platform must be built next to the old main platform. At about the same time, the Norwegian gas transport systems were combined in a new joint venture (Gassled) operated by the newly established national company Gassco. For Heimdal, this meant that Equinor transferred the operatorship for the new riser platform to Gassco, and since then there have been two operators at Heimdal. In 2011, it was decided to bring the gas from the Valemon field to Heimdal for processing. Valemon took over the gas pipeline from Huldra, where production had ended. Thanks to the Valemon agreement, Heimdal’s productive life could be extended, which in turn enabled extended profitable production from Skirne and Vale, and the development of the small Atla field. The Vale and Skirne fields have produced better than expected. Equinor has appointed a dedicated project to prepare for the decommissioning of the field and removal of the two platforms. The removal project is working for both the Heimdal licence (the main platform) and for Gassled (the riser platform). This spring contracts for platform removal were awarded to Heerema – the same company that installed the Heimdal platform on the field in 1985. The platforms are scheduled to be removed in the period 2025-2027 and brought ashore at Eldøyane, Stord, for scrapping, reuse and recirculation – more than fifty years after the field was discovered by the drilling of well 25/4-1 in 1972. When the operations at Heimdal end in 2023 the remaining gas reserves at Valemon will be transferred to Kvitebjørn and Kollsnes for processing. Gassled will reconnect the dry gas pipelines currently passing over Heimdal to a subsea bypass.","Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor is extending the life of the Heimdal gas centre, located in the North Sea, to 2023.","['Equinor', 'Heimdal', 'Gassco', 'Valemon', 'Authority', 'ELF', 'Gassled', 'Heerema', 'Norsk Hydro']","['Geir Sørtveit']","['Heimdal', 'Kårstø', 'North Sea', 'Norway', 'Skirne', 'UK', 'Europe', 'Huldra', 'Kollsnes', 'Oseberg', 'Stord', 'Vale']"

Equinor and its partners have decided to extend operations at the Heimdal gas centre in the Norwegian North Sea until 2023. The decision comes as the partners plan to drill new wells at the Valemon field, which is located between production licences 050 and 193. The subsequent production is transported to Heimdal gas processing and distribution hub, which comprises an integrated steel platform and a new riser platform. During 2021-2022, the partners are planning to drill three to four new gas wells at the Valemon field to boost its production. This is expected to help the Heimdal Gas Centre to sustain profitable operations slightly longer than its original closure date in 2021 or 2022, Equinor said. The gas centre mainly processes gas produced from the satellite fields Huldra, Skirne, Atla, and Vale, as well as minor gas volumes from the Heimdal reservoir itself. The company anticipates the extension of operations of the Heimdal gas centre to be useful from a socioeconomic perspective. It would also enable the production of the remaining reserves in Skirne and Vale while boosting production from the Valemon field.

Members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter urging customs officials to “immediately take aggressive enforcement actions” regarding polysilicon products entering the United States from Xinjiang, China. The letter to acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner Troy Miller was dated June 10 and was signed by two dozen members of the congressional tax writing committee. The letter complained that the agency has been slow in following up on forced labor allegations and “has yet to take a single enforcement action.” The letter said that customs officials had received allegations in late 2020 and suggested “imminent enforcement action” three months ago. “We believe it is time to act,” the letter said. The letter said that enough evidence exists to trigger action under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. §1307). It called on the customs agency to take “strong action.” Section 307 bars the importation of goods made by convict labor or forced labor. The site of a former coal plant in New York State could host a 140-200 MW solar array under plans being floated by Applied Energy Services (AES). The project was first proposed by sPower, which AES acquired in late 2020. Land for the project would be leased from Beowulf Energy. The project would be reviewed by the Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) committee under the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act, or 94-c, which was passed as a part of the 2020-21 state budget. Local reports said that approval could come in late 2022 with construction taking place during most of 2023. The project could have an in-service date in 2024. AES has invested about $2 million into the project, including legal work and engineering, and is investigating the possibility of a Payment in Lieu of Taxes agreement. During its operation, the coal plant where AES intends to build operated under a similar an agreement. A unit of Greenbacker Renewable Energy bought the 20-MW West River portfolio of pre-operational solar projects from Energy of Utah. The projects include West River Solar and West River Solar II and have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Basin Electric Power. Both projects are located in Pennington County, South Dakota, home to Mount Rushmore. The projects are near Fall River Solar, an 80 MW solar project Greenbacker bought in late 2020 from the same developer. The West River portfolio is expected to reach commercial operations in December 2022. With the acquisition, Greenbacker will own around 1.12 GW of generating capacity, including 853.6 MW of utility-scale and distributed solar facilities, 242.6 MW of wind facilities, 16 MW of battery storage, and 12 MW of biomass facilities. Sunnova Energy International priced its latest securitization of leases and power purchases agreements. The single-tranche securitization consists of $319.0 million in A- (sf) rated 2.58% notes at a 76.4% advance rate, representing a spread to the benchmark swap rate of 140 bps. The A- rated notes carry a weighted average life of approximately 7.46 years through the Anticipated Repayment Date of April 30, 2031 and have a final maturity of April 28, 2056. The notes are backed by a portfolio of more than 20,900 solar rooftop systems distributed across 18 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Northern Mariana Islands. The weighted average customer FICO score of the customers is around 740. Sunnova said it intends to use the proceeds from the sale to repay financing arrangements of its business units. The transaction is expected to close by June 17, subject to closing conditions. Quoting state planners, Reuters said that China will no longer grant subsidies for new solar power stations, distributed solar projects by commercial users, or onshore wind projects from the central government budget in 2021. Electricity generated from the new projects will be sold at local benchmark coal-fired power prices or at market prices, the government statement said.

The consortium is now working to prepare applications for projects in the Utsira Nord area, deemed better suitable for floating wind technology, and Sørlige Nordsjø II, which borders with Danish waters and which the three partners see as ideal for a connection to continental Europe. “We see Norway as interesting both in the perspective of supplying enough renewable energy to Europe and to develop floating offshore wind solutions that can become commercially viable”, said Hessel de Jong, Shell’s General Manager for Offshore Wind in Europe. The companies have plans to utilise offshore wind energy for electricity supply to the grid in combination with hydropower and for electrification of oil and gas assets. “The North Sea has one of the best wind resources in the world. When this produces, we can hold back the water in our reservoirs. In calm periods, we can cover the demand for power by phasing in hydro-production”, said Jannicke Hilland, CEO of Statnett-owned hydropower producer BKK. “We wish to contribute to the electrification of the oil and gas industry and connect the offshore wind potential of the Southern North Sea to relevant markets in Europe. The interaction between offshore wind and hydropower will be an advantage for us.” Eimund Nygaard, CEO of Lyse, said the three partners had not pre-selected any technologies or suppliers so far, but that their projects would represent great opportunities for the Norwegian offshore industry. “The global market for offshore wind is growing rapidly and we aim to be a platform where Norwegian suppliers can develop competitive advantages to succeed in international tenders”, Eimund Nygaard said. Shell and its partners are the latest of several companies and consortia to announce the decision to apply for acreage off Norway, after the government opened the Sørlige Nordsjø II and Utsira Nord areas last year. A few days ago, British oil and gas major BP was reported to be joining Statkraft and Aker Offshore Wind in a bid for the Sørlige Nordsjø II area, with this consortium also having plans to explore opportunities to power offshore oil and gas facilities with clean electricity. For Utsira Nord, the award process is anticipated to begin by the end of this year. For the Sørlige Nordsjø II area, the Norwegian government is expected to make award announcements in the first quarter of 2022. Enova is the vehicle to support the development of floating offshore wind technology. The government will consider increasing its grants to Enova as part of the regular state budget process when the time comes to award concessions to prospective developers at Utsira Nord. The considerations of financial support will depend on the technological development and the maturity of the floating wind projects. According to the latest information from Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, the government presupposes that bottom-fixed offshore wind at Sørlige Nordsjø II will be built without state aid. The government is currently working on an assessment of hybrid projects at Sørlige Nordsjø II for which the industry had advocated to allow for the power to be brought onshore both in Norway and abroad, enabling import and export of electricity.","Dutch oil major Shell has partnered with Norwegian hydropower producers BKK and Lyse to apply for licenses in two areas currently offered by Norwegian government for offshore wind development.","['Shell', 'BKK', 'Lyse', 'Aker Offshore Wind', 'BP', 'Ministry of Petroleum and Energy', 'Statkraft', 'Statnett-owned']","['Eimund Nygaard', 'Hessel de Jong', 'Jannicke Hilland']","['Norway', 'Sørlige', 'Europe', 'Utsira', 'Sea']"

Shell has partnered with renewable energy companies BKK and Lyse to apply for the licenses for developing two offshore wind fields in Norway. The Sørlige Nordsjø II and Utsira Nord offshore fields have been opened up by the Norwegian authorities for development. The three companies recently signed a cooperation agreement plan to develop offshore wind projects in these regions. Norske Shell CEO Marianne Olsnes said: “We are establishing a long-term, industrial partnership with a common ambition to be central in the work with green change. “With this, we will contribute to the development of profitable jobs and sustainable industry in Norway. “Working together, we can offer the best, from global to local resources, in a joint project and become a very solid applicant for these offshore wind licenses. “Shell has been a global player in wind power for more than 20 years, with wind power projects in Europe, the USA and Asia.” The three companies, who have started preparing their applications, believe that Sørlig Nordsjø II has great potential due to its strategic location on the border of the Danish Shelf. This location will allow clean energy to be exported from the offshore field to other parts of Europe. The Norwegian authorities will allow up to 1,500MW of offshore wind capacity to be developed in the Utsira Nord and up to 3,000MW in Sørlige Nordsjø II.

MELBOURNE, June 23 (Reuters) - Shale gas explorer Tamboran Resources is set to debut on the Australian bourse on June 30 in the country’s biggest oil and gas float in a decade, pitching itself as a growth story despite the world’s push toward greener energy. Tamboran owns assets in the Beetaloo shale sub-basin in the Northern Territory, considered comparable to the prolific Marcellus Shale, the biggest U.S. natural gas field. It aims to start producing in 2025. “If they can get the flow rates that are needed to be economic, the Beetaloo could have quite a big impact on the Australian gas industry,” said Daniel Toleman, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. The Australian government, eager to see the remote basin developed, has committed A$224 million to improve roads and spur drilling there. Beetaloo exploration was halted in 2016 when the Northern Territory banned hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking. It lifted the ban in 2018. A lack of infrastructure makes Beetaloo development challenging. The roads are so bad that during the wet season, trucks can’t enter. Tamboran is bringing sand from 2,000 km (1,200 miles) away in South Australia for fracking. “It’s going to require billions of dollars to develop the Beetaloo. There’s a question where the appetite for that level of development capital is going to come,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic. Tamboran raised more than A$60 million ($45 million), just above the low end of its target range, but that was cut from an initial target of A$80 million, Managing Director Joel Riddle said. At the offer price of A$0.40 a share, the company will have a market value of about A$260 million when it lists on June 30. The funds raised will be used to drill three wells in the next 12 months, including two with Santos Ltd, in two assets estimated to have 31 trillion cubic feet of prospective resources, net to Tamboran. Tamboran attracted institutional investors in Australia, the United States, Europe and Asia. “A lot of the interest we’re seeing is from institutional investors that have been part of the success story of the shale revolution in the U.S.,” Riddle told Reuters. Tamboran’s Chairman Richard Stoneburner was a co-founder of U.S. shale developer Petrohawk, sold to BHP Group for $12 billion in 2011. Marketing for the float coincided with an International Energy Agency call in May for no new hydrocarbon investments to meet global carbon targets. Fielding investors’ climate concerns, Riddle pitched Tamboran as a “net zero” producer. Beetaloo gas has a carbon dioxide (CO2) content of just 3%, which the company plans to offset using renewable energy, carbon credits, and carbon capture. “As long as you have a real strategy for mitigating your CO2 footprint, I actually think it could be a pretty strong story,” said Regal Funds Management analyst James Hood. He declined to say whether Regal bought Tamboran shares. Tamboran aims to sell its gas in Australia and to Asia. It hopes to raise more money based on drilling results in late 2022 by selling stakes in its assets, ideally to major companies with interests in liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Darwin or Queensland. “We’re already getting lots of interest from the likes of Inpex and Total and a few other parties on the east coast,” Riddle said.

"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/06/21/concrete-flywheel-storage-system-for-residential-pv/","https://www.pv-magazine.com/","Concrete flywheel storage system for residential PV","2021-06-21 13:00:36","A French start-up has developed a concrete flywheel to store solar energy in an innovative way. Currently being tested in France, the storage solution will be initially offered in France’s overseas territories and Africa. From pv magazine France. France-based start-up Energiestro has developed a storage technology for residential PV based on a flywheel system based on concrete. A flywheel system is able to store electricity by converting it into kinetic energy using a motor to spin a rotor. The flywheel rotates at such a high speed that the electrical power is transformed into mechanical power. The proposed solution consists of a hollow, solid cylinder that is rotated around an axis and connected to an electric motor and generator. “When you have the energy to store, the engine drives the flywheel, which accelerates,” said the company's co-founder and general director, André Gennesseaux. “In the other direction, the motor can act as a brake to discharge the electricity.” To date, according to the manufacturer, most of the steering wheels used for this kind of storage were made of steel. “But steel flywheels have a limit: their price, while stationary storage users are looking, above all, for the best costs,” Gennesseaux explained. “Some companies are also developing carbon cylinders, which are much lighter but, again, very expensive while our approach is not to work primarily on the weight because in this type of applications, it does not matter.” According to the general director, carbon flywheels currently cost around €250/kWh, steel flywheels €200/kWh and concrete ones around a few euros. “The particularity of our patented technology is that the concrete cylinder is pre-stressed by a winding of fiberglass and is held in a vacuum to avoid friction,” Gennesseaux stated. Thanks to this, maintenance operations are reduced because the mechanical part is sealed and the lubricating oil is also in a vacuum environment, without risk of oxidation. The flywheel is guaranteed for 30 years and a change of its inverter is expected after 15 years. “At the beginning, we chose concrete for price reasons, but we quickly found that its life cycle analysis was also positive,” Gennesseaux went on to say. “We are around 10 grams of CO2 per kWh, while lithium-ion batteries are around 40g CO2/kWh, at the same level as steel flywheels.” Currently, Energiestro offers a standard storage solution with a nominal power of around 10 kW, which corresponds to a charge and discharge cycle in one hour. The steering wheel has a diameter of one meter and weighs three tons, and can be placed in the garden of a private house. The system capacity should be increased, initially, to 20 kWh, and then 50 kWh, to eventually reach 24 hours of storage. “The size limit will be given by logistics as we have to find cranes capable of burying the flywheels in the ground, which is why we are limiting ourselves to 50 kWh in our current business plan,” Gennesseaux added, noting that the solution will be initially offered in France's overseas territories and Africa. The French company received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. “As a beta-test, we have a demonstration project with Voltalia in Guyana,” Gennesseaux said. “In this context, we will install a 10 kWh flywheel which will manage fluctuations on the network for one hour if a cloud passes.” According to him, in hot and humid regions, the steering wheels are much more robust and reliable than lithium-ion batteries. The company is also working in partnership with Engie on the Thémis solar power plant project in the Pyrénées-Orientales (3.4 MWp) where several 10 kWh flywheels will be installed with the objective of verifying the impact of this technology in frequency regulation, compared to lithium-ion batteries.","A French start-up has developed a concrete flywheel to store solar energy in an innovative way.
