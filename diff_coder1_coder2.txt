Both articles are about climate change and emissions-reducing technologies for Australia, however they describe different sub-stories: One is about the G7 Summit in Cornwall and the other is about a project launch of a $43 million program aimed at identifying how to reduce emissions in industry. Since we have defined news chains in an event-oriented manner, we would classify this article pair as unrelated.

Article 1 talks about Plans for a renewable hydrogen production facility in Australia.
Article 2 talks about the Australian project Asian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) which was rejected due to environmental concerns.
The articles are therefore not related.
